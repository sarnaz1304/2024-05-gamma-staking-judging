# `isEarlyExitDisabled` is misconfigured in `Lock` Contract

## Summary
The  `Lock` contract doesn't start with the right early exit setup as mentioned in the README.md file. This means users can leave early when they shouldn't be able to.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the README.md file, the ability to perform early exits should be disabled by default. Here's the relevant excerpt:
```markdown
The ability to earlyExit will be toggled off by default.
```
This suggests that the `isEarlyExitDisabled` variable in the `Lock.sol` contract should be set to true initially, disabling the ability for users to perform early exits from their locks.

When the contract is deployed, the `isEarlyExitDisabled` variable is set to false by default. The contract owner can later disable early exits by calling `setIsEarlyExitDisabled(true)`, but until then, users can freely call the `earlyExitById` function.

## Impact
This mistake can cause confusion and allow users to leave early when they shouldn't.
