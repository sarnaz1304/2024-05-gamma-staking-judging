# Lack of Input Validation for Reward Tokens can lead to unexpected behavior

## Summary

In the `addReward()` function, the contract fails to check whether the `_rewardToken` is a valid contract address and ERC20 token. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This lack of input validation might allow an attacker to pass a malicious contract or EOA (Externally Owned Accounts) as `_rewardToken` causing unexpected behavior of the smart contract.

## Impact

Unexpected behavior of the smart contract

## Code Snippet

In the `addReward` function, although there are checks for zero address and checks if the `_rewardToken` is already added, no validation is performed to check the validity of the `_rewardToken` as an ERC20 token or as a valid contract.
```solidity
function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
    if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
    if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
    if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
    rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
    rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;
    Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
    reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check to ensure that `_rewardToken` is a valid ERC20 token. You can achieve that by calling the `balanceOf()` function from `_rewardToken` address and check if this call is successful. If not, revert the transaction to avoid invalid or harmful `rewardToken` to be added.

The modified `addReward` function with the new check will look like:
```solidity
function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
    if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
    if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
    if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();

    // New check for valid ERC20 token
    (bool success, ) = _rewardToken.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("balanceOf(address)", address(this)));
    require(success, "Reward token is not a valid ERC20 token");

    rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
    rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;
    Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
    reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
    emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
}
```
