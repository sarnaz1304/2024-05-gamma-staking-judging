# Some ERC20 can revert on a zero value transfers

## Summary

In spite of the fact that [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/46b9b698815abbfa628cd1097311deee77dd45c5/EIPS/eip-20.md?plain=1#L116) states that zero-valued transfers must be accepted, some tokens, such as `LEND` will revert if this is attempted, which may cause transactions that involve other tokens (such as batch operations) to fully revert. Consider skipping the transfer if the amount is zero, which will also save gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

function `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` and `withdrawUnlockedTokenById` doesn't check for zero amount while transferring staking tokens. This may leads to issue if the amount is 0.

## Impact

Some ERC20 implementations revert on zero value transfers

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

check whether the `totalUnlocked` is 0

```solidity
   if(totalUnlocked != 0){
        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked);
    }
```

same as for `lockedBal.amount`

```solidity
 if(lockedBal.amount != 0){
        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lockedBal.amount);
  }
```
