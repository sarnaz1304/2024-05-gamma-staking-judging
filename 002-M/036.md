# If user calls `exitLateById` for the same lock, he looses `lock.amount` of his stakes

## Summary
`exitLateById` never check if provided lockId has already been exited, which result in decreasing using balance one more time, (X2), but it is withdrawable only one time.
## Vulnerability Detail

When a user wants to restake he has to call [exitLateById](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349) passing the `id` of his lock. This operation decreases the value of the following state variables:
```solidity
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
        lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
        bal.locked -= lock.amount;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
```
which is `msg.sender` corresponding staking balance in the system. A big problem arises if the user calls the `earlyExitById` for the same id two times because it would decrease one more time the staking balance of the user, which results in locked funds and loss for those tokens. This is the case, because when he would later call `withdrawUnlockedTokenById`, it would withdraw only `lock.amount`.
**NOTE** - user should have another active lock, which would later be impossible to  close(exit)


Imagine the following scenario:
For simplicity we assume that multiplier for this time is 1
1. Bob stakes 1000e18 Gama tokens in the system for 30 days.
2. State of the system after this action:
```solidity
       Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier = 1000e18;
        lockedSupply = 1000e18;
        bal.locked = 1000e18;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 1000e18;
```
3. After 2 days Bob decides to stake another 1000e18 Gama tokens and do the same. 
4. State of the system after this action:
- Bob has locks with id {0, 1}
```solidity
       Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier = 1000e18;
        lockedSupply = 2000e18;
        bal.locked = 2000e18;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 2000e18;
```
5. After 28 days he want to exit the system and calls `exitLateById` with id = 0 
6. Lock info is updated to be unlocked after two days and his balance is decreased by 1000e18.
7. He wants to do the same for id = 1, but instead he again submit tx for id = 0
8. The tx passes, because function never check if this id has already been exited and as a result his balance is decreased with another 1000e18 tokens:
```solidity
       Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier = 0;
        lockedSupply = 0;
        bal.locked = 0;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 0;

```
9. Now if he try to call `exitLateById`, tx will [revert with underflow here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L363-L364)
10. When he calls `withdrawUnlockedTokenById` for `id=0` he receives onlt 1000e18, because this is the `amount` of the lock.
11. -> Result: Thsoe 1000e18 are lost forever and cannot be escaped from the contract

## Impact

## Recommendation

Inside `exitLateById` check if `exitedLate` has already be set:
```diff
  function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
+require(!lockedBalance.exitedLate, "This lock has already been exited");

        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.
...
