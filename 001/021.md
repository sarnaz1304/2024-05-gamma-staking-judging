# `calcRemainUnlockPeriod` calculation is wrong if `lockPeriod % defaultRelockTime != 0`

## Summary
`calcRemainUnlockPeriod` wrongfully calculates lock time if `lockPeriod` is not divisible by `defaultRelockTime`

## Vulnerability Detail
After a user's lock finishes, it is supposed to automatically gets relocked for the lesser of user's `lockPeriod` or `defaultRelockTime`
> Each lock created by staker will have its own unlock time, which will automatically be relocked for the duration of the lesser of the user's current lockPeriod or defaultRelockTime so long as the user does not call exitLateById

However, the current implementation of `calcRemainUnlockPeriod` doesn't actually do that 
```solidity
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```

In the case where `lockPeriod` is not divisible by `defaultRelockTime`, user's first relock will be for less than supposed to.
Example scenario:
1. User has locked for `lockPeriod` of 50 days. `defaultRelockTime` is 30 days.
2. Just after user's lock of 50 days finishes, instead of relocking for 30 days as supposed to, the contract will lock the funds for only 10 days (until day 60, instead of until day 80), since `defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime = 30 - (50 % 30) = 30 - 20 = 10 days` 
3. If the user's aware of this they'll be able to withdraw their funds earlier than supposed to. If they're not and they try to unlock their funds 30 days after the original lockPeriod end has finished, they'll have to unexpectedly wait more as they've entered a new period. 


## Impact
Users might be able to withdraw earlier than supposed to.

```diff
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
-            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
+            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - (lockTime + lockPeriod)) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
