# Blacklisted User's would create an issue.

## Summary
- If user got blacklisted it would create a problem
## Vulnerability Detail
- There can be two scenario's :
   - User stake USDT assets and after the User gets blacklisted and cannot interact with any USDT transaction, in this case he cannot withdraw his USDT back.
   - Let's suppose USDT is our reward token and one of our stakers got blacklisted , now due to blacklisting he cannot withdraw other reward tokens as well because all rewards are being distributed through getAllRewards()  and inside it there is for loop for all reward token and and that point our USDT transaction for blacklisted user would revert. 
   
## Impact
- Blacklisted address would not able to claim other reward token as well
