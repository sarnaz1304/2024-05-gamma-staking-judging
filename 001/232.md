# User might irreversibly lose his rewards

## Summary
User might irreversibly lose his rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can stake GAMMA tokens in order to receive rewards. The rewards, as specified by the protocol, will be in the following tokens: WETH, GAMMA, USDC and USDT. The issue that will be explained below is likely to happen if the token is USDC due to the fact that it only has 6 decimals.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. The `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` is 1e25 (that is 10000000 total staked GAMMA tokens with 1 multiplier, very likely)
2. User decides to stake 1e18 GAMMA tokens
3. After some time, 1 USDC is deposited as rewards, thus `cumulatedReward` is now $1e6 * 1e36 / 1e25 = 1e17$
4. User decides to get his rewards and his rewards mapping is now equal to $1e18 * 1e17 = 1e35$
5. Then, we end up here:
```solidity
if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0;
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36;

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36);
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36;
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36);
            }
```
6. This will round down to 0 and the user will not receive any rewards despite his mapping being cleared

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use this if check instead:
```diff
+ if (reward >= 1e36)
- if (reward > 0)
```
