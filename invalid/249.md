# Lack of Protection Against Short Address Attack

## Summary

The contract accepts and utilizes user-controlled inputs (i.e., `amount`) without verifying if the length of the incoming data matches the length expected by a function, which can make the contract vulnerable to a Short Address Attack. 

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker could manipulate off-chain systems (centralized exchanges or UIs) that interact with this contract. For instance, if an exchange doesn't validate the length of the `amount` input while also using the `transfer` function in their code, an attacker may convince a victim to call a function on this contract with incorrect parameters. 

## Impact

In a scenario where the victim naively complies without necessary checks but the internal logic of the contract behaves differently, the execution would differ from the expected behavior.

For example, an attacker may encode an `_amount` originally meant for a `transfer` function as `0x10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (130 zero bits appended to a 1) aiming to transfer 2^128 = 3.4e38 tokens. However, if only 31 bytes are supplied due to the short address attack, `_amount` will be equivalent to 1, thereby making the attacker control the value of `_amount` transferred to their account.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L245-L251

```solidity
function stake(
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint256 typeIndex
) external override {
    _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It would be recommended to consistently check the `msg.data.length` at the start of each function. 

For instance, if `amount` is not consumed immediately by the function as a direct argument, but it's read within a `Stake` struct, a defensive check would multiply each of the input parameters by their expected length (usually 32 bytes) to ensure the length of `msg.data` aligns with the expected total length.

This is how one can add the protection against the short address attack:

```solidity
function stake(
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint256 typeIndex
) external override {
    require(
        msg.data.length >= (3 * 32) + 4,
        "Stake: Invalid input - potential short address attack"
    );
    _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
}
```

This function checks if function data is at least as long as expected to avoid truncation of data and guard against a potential short address attack.
