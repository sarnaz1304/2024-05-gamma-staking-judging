# Missing checks for address(0) when assigning values to address state variables

## Summary
Missing zero address check in `Lock::setTreasury`
## Vulnerability Detail
the vulnerability arises from the absence of a validation step in the `Lock::setTreasury` function that prevents the assignment of the zero address to the `treasury` variable. The zero address in Ethereum represents an uninitialized or "empty" address, and assigning it to a variable typically means that no actual address was provided. This can happen due to user error, malicious intent, or unexpected contract interaction.


## Impact
Setting the `treasury` to zero address will potentially lock up these funds or causing operational failures.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the setTreasury function should include a check to ensure that the _treasury address is not the zero address before proceeding with the assignment. This can be achieved by adding a simple conditional statement that reverts the transaction if the _treasury address is the zero address. Here's how the recommended modification could look:
```js
function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
    require(_treasury!= address(0), "Treasury cannot be the zero address");
    treasury = _treasury;
    emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
}
```
By incorporating this check, the contract ensures that the treasury address remains valid and operational, thereby enhancing its resilience against unintended disruptions caused by incorrect or malicious input.
