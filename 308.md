# Excessive newReward Due to Incorrect Precision handling in __notifyReward

## Summary
The `_notifyReward` function incorrectly multiplies reward by `1e36`, causing excessively high newReward values. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_notifyReward` function in the Lock contract incorrectly handles precision when calculating the `newReward` value. This can lead to an excessively high `newReward` due to the multiplication by `1e36`. Both reward and `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` are already in 18 decimals, and multiplying reward by 1e36 before dividing by `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` results in an incorrect scaling.

Example
Consider the following scenario:
    rewardToken has 18 decimals.
    reward is 5 * 10^18 (5 tokens).
    lockedSupplyWithMultiplier is 10^18 (1 token with multiplier).
Current implementation:
```solidity
uint256 newReward = reward * 1e36 / lockedSupplyWithMultiplier;
```
Substituting the values:
```solidity

newReward = (5 * 10^18) * 1e36 / 10^18;
newReward = 5 * 10^36;

```
This results in newReward being 5 * 10^36, which is excessively high and incorrect.

## Impact
The incorrect precision handling can lead to an inflated newReward
