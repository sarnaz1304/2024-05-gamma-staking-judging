# No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contracts From Attacker


## Summary
No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contract From Attacker
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract `Lock` implements Openzeppelin’s Upgradeable model, uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with initialize function, it’s recommended to invoke the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker. However the contract which implements PausableUpgradeable and OwnableUpgradeable do not call _disableInitializers in the constructors


## Impact
Uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with initialize function. Conduct a phishing scam at this contract address since it was deployed by the Gamma Team.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
+ constructor() {
+        _disableInitializers();
+    }
```
