# `unlockTime` updated incorrectly in `earlyExitById()`

## Summary
`unlockTime` updated incorrectly in `earlyExitById()`

## Vulnerability Detail
`earlyExitById()` sets the `unlockTime` for a given lock to the same value that `exitLateById()` sets it to even though the first function is used to unlock the users staking tokens earlier:
```solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        //...
        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);
        //...
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
```
```solidity
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        //...
        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id);

        //...
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs); //does the same as the setting unlockTime manually
```
## Impact
Not sure for the impact on this one. Perhaps the devs intended the flow of the code to be different at first such as `earlyExitById()` not returning the staked tokens back to the user like it does now. Instead, after calling `earlyExitById()` the user was supposed to call one of the withdraw functions which would check the `unlockTime` of the user's lock and give his tokens back.

## Recommendation
```diff
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        //...
        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);
        //...
-       lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
+       lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp;
```
