# Looping over unbounded array can result in a state of DoS.

## Summary
The stake function can be used to stake on behalf of others by passing their address as onBehalfOf. The amount does not need to be zero; it can be as small as 1 wei. An attacker could exploit this feature to increase the lock count for a user. Consequently, when the user calls withdrawAllUnlockedToken, it could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) due to running out of gas.








## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say our user has many locks with different stake amounts. An attacker starts increasing the lock count with only 1 wei, so when the user tries to call withdrawAllUnlockedToken, it results in an Out of Gas (OOG) error, making this function unusable.

## Impact
Calling withdrawAllUnlockedToken will result in DOS making it unusable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should not allow staking with a small amount such as 1 wei, which will make this attack unfeasible.  
```solidity
    function _stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex,
        bool isRelock
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        if (typeIndex >= lockPeriod.length || amount >= 1 ether)
            revert InvalidAmount();
        ...
    }
```
