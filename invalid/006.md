# `PausableUpgradeable` contract is not initialized in `Lock.sol`

## Summary
`PausableUpgradeable` contract is not initialized in `Lock.sol` contract

## Vulnerability Detail
Every `upgradeable` contract from openzeppelin has `init()` function which is supposed to be called in the `initialize()` function of the inheriting contract to `initialize` the upgradable contract.

//From openzeppelin PausableUpgradeable.sol
```solidity
   /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract in unpaused state.
     */
    function __Pausable_init() internal onlyInitializing {
        __Pausable_init_unchained();
    }
```
Now, the problem is it is not initialized in the `Lock.sol`
```solidity
 function initialize(
        address _locklist,
        uint128 _basePenaltyPercentage,
        uint128 _timePenaltyFraction,
        address _owner
    ) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        if (_locklist == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (_basePenaltyPercentage > WHOLE || _timePenaltyFraction > WHOLE)
            revert WrongScaledPenaltyAmount();

        locklist = ILockList(_locklist);
        basePenaltyPercentage = _basePenaltyPercentage;
        timePenaltyFraction = _timePenaltyFraction;
        defaultRelockTime = 30 days;
    }
```

## Impact
`whenNotPaused` is used in all core function like `getReward()`, `stake()`, `earlyExitById()`. As a result it will not work as intended

## Recommendation
Call `__Pausable_init()` in initialize function
