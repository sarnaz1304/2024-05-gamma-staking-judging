# Unable to recover inactive reward tokens

## Summary

`Lock::recoverERC20` is unable to recover inactive reward tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

From the description of `Lock::recoverERC20()`, [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L651-L652) we can clearify that the admin should be able to recover reward tokens aswell as long as said tokens are inactive(are not actively used for rewards/ have not acumulated rewards), this is further backed by the fact that `Lock::recoverERC20()` only checks the `lastUpdateTimestamp` instead of the `rewardTokenAdded` mapping. However Because the `Lock::addReward()` function updates the `lastUpdateTimestamp` immediately a reward token is added ,this functionality is broken as `Lock::recoverERC20()` assumes the token is active even though it hasn't accumulated any rewards.

## Impact

Medium, possible functionality break

```diff
function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
-       reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```
