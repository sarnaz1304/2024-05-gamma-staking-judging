# The user won't accumulate rewards for his unlock time when exiting by  `exitLateById`

## Summary
If users exit late, there is a period they have to wait to get their money back and even though their money is still locked, the money does not accumulate rewards during that time.

## Vulnerability Detail
When staking, it is intended for users to accumulate rewards for their money. They can exit the stake by `earlyExitById` and `exitLateById`. If they exit early they get immediately part of their staked amount and stop accumulating rewards but if they exit late, there is a period they have to wait to get their money back. The problem is that even though their money is still locked, they are not accumulating rewards during this time.

## Impact
The user won't accumulate rewards for his unlock time when exiting by  `exitLateById`.

## Recommendation
