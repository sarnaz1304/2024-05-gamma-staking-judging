# Precision Errors in Mathematical Operations

medium 
Mathematical Operations

## Summary
The LockList contract performs various calculations, including determining the count of locks for a user, retrieving a specific lock, and calculating locked, unlockable, and lock-with-multiplier balances. These calculations involve arithmetic operations that could potentially lead to precision errors or incorrect results due to the inherent limitations of integer arithmetic in Solidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
The primary concern lies in the use of integer division or multiplication by large constants, which can lead to precision loss. For instance, converting percentages into fractions by dividing by a large constant (e.g., 1e18) can result in truncated values, leading to rounding errors. Similarly, multiplying values by multipliers stored as integers can also introduce precision issues.

## Impact
Precision errors in calculations can lead to incorrect contract states or unexpected behavior. For example, inaccurate calculations of locked, unlockable, or lock-with-multiplier balances could misrepresent a user's holdings or entitlements. Over time, these errors could accumulate, potentially leading to significant discrepancies in the contract's state.

## Recommendation
Consider Using Fixed-Point Arithmetic: For calculations requiring high precision, consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library like OpenZeppelin's FixedPoint to avoid precision loss.
