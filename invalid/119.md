# Inactive Reward tokens can never be recovered : Funds will be stuck indefinitely

## Summary
The `Lock.sol` holds an array of reward tokens that are used by the protocol to incentivize 
the stakers for locking their staking tokens. The rewards are standard ERC20 tokens.
There is a method to add reward tokens to the lock system and that method is `addReward` which is owner only.

While most rewards will be active ,  some of them might be in-active for longer periods of time i.e 2 years or 4 years

In that time , there is a special function to recover those in-active reward tokens from the Lock system 

and that method is `recoverERC20` which is used to recover those in-active tokens 

if and only if they are `not active ( lastUpdatedTime= 0` ) and the token to be recovered is not the staking token.

However , there's a flaw in the code that assumes that when the token is in active for years , the `lastUpdatedTime` might be 

equal to zero however , there's no place in the code that sets the token to inactive state ( marking its `lastUpdatedTime= 0` )

All the points that manipulate the `lastUpdatedTime` , they always set it to

 `non-zero block.timestamp > 0 because block.timestamp can never be zero `

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue exists in `Lock.recoverERC20` method

```solidity
    /// @notice Allows the contract owner to recover ERC-20 tokens sent to the contract under specific conditions.
    /// @dev This function can only be executed by the contract owner and is meant for recovering tokens that are not actively being used as rewards or are not the staking token itself.
    ///      It checks if the token is currently active as a reward or if it's the staking token to prevent accidental or unauthorized recovery.
    /// @param tokenAddress The address of the ERC-20 token to be recovered.
    /// @param tokenAmount The amount of the token to be recovered.
    function recoverERC20(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        if (rewardData[tokenAddress].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert ActiveReward(); // Ensure the token is not currently active as a reward.
        if (tokenAddress == stakingToken) revert WrongRecoveryToken(); // Prevent recovery of the staking token.
        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner(), tokenAmount); // Transfer the specified amount of the token to the contract owner.
        emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount); // Emit an event to log the recovery operation.
    }
```

The Natspec states the purpose of this method :

 `meant for recovering tokens that are not actively being used as rewards or are not the staking token itself.`

The method is not intended to allow recovering tokens that are active , ensured by following line 

```solidity
if (rewardData[tokenAddress].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert ActiveReward(); // Ensure the token is not currently active as a reward.
```
it means if `lastUpdateTime ` is `0` then it will allow withdrawing it from Lock 

however ,if we look at all the places where `lastUpdateTime ` is being set 

```solidity
  function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        //snip
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        //snip
    }

 function _notifyReward(address _rewardToken, uint256 reward) internal {
       //snip
        Reward storage r = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Accesses the reward structure for the specified token.
        r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.
       //snip

    }
```

If we check these assignments , its evident that `lastUpdateTime ` will always be `>0` because `block.timestamp is always >0`

As `lastUpdateTime` will never be set to `0` , reward tokens will never be taken out from Lock contract

and tokens worth Billions of Dollars will get stuck in the contract that are not active.

## Impact
Loss of funds to the protocol when reward tokens are not used as active rewards and tokens will be stuck.
### Severity
As this issue  causes `Definite loss of funds without (extensive) limitations of external conditions`, according to sherlock rules , it's a valid High severity issue.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L659
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Apply some threshold for marking a token as in-active like if 365 days are passed , and the token is not used as a reward token

that token can be recovered.

Another method can be to add a setter method for marking rewards tokens to be in-active and then withdrawing through

recoverERC20 method.
