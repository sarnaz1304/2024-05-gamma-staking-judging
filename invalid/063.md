# User is able to stake and earlyExit with no penalty fee

## Summary
User is able to stake tokens and execute `Lock::earlyExit` with no penalty fee, if the amount of staked tokens is small enough

## Vulnerability Detail
User could stake some tokens(with amount of 2 for example) by executing `Lock::stake` and when some reward tokens are added in the contract followed by `Lock::notifyUnseenReward`, user is now going to be able to acquire new rewards as intended. However, user is also going to be able to call `Lock::earlyExitById` anytime he wants and get his stake tokens back with no penalty fee due to missing rounding up in the `Lock::calcPenaltyAmount` final calculation equation.
```solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {

       .....

        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);

       .....

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }

function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }
``` 
Note that penaltyAmount = 0, only if the staked amount is small enough based on the time left until unlock

For example: 
    -  unlockTime - block.timestamp = 25 days = 2 160 000
    - timePenaltyFraction = 35 000
    - lockPeriod = 30 days = 2 592 000
    - basePenaltyPercentage = 15 000
   Therefore penaltyFactor = 2 160 000 * 35 000 / 2 592 000 + 15 000 = 44 166
    - WHOLE = 100 000
    And if the staked amount is 2 this mean penaltyAmount = 2 * 44 166 / 100 000 = 0

## Impact
protocol loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use roundUp in the last row as shown below:
```diff
function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;

        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
+       if (userLock.amount * penaltyFactor % WHOLE > 0) penaltyAmount += 1;
    }
```
