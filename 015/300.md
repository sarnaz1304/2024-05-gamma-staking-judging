# `recoverERC20` can be frontrun to render it useless

## Summary
`recoverERC20` can be frontun to render it useless.

## Vulnerability Detail
`recoverERC20` is a owner-restricted function to recover any ERC-20 tokens that were sent to the Lock contract but are not used for rewards. To check whether it is being used as reward, it does the following check:
```solidity
if (rewardData[tokenAddress].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert ActiveReward();
```
If the token to be recovered is registered as a reward token, any malicious user can cause the recovery to revert by frontrunning it with a `notifyUnseenReward` call with the token's address. This function calls `_notifyReward` which sets the `lastUpdateTime` to a non-zero value.
```solidity
r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.
```
This will cause `recoverERC20` call to revert and the funds to be recovered distributed as reward among the stakers.

## Impact
`recoverERC20` is rendered useless, and any reward token funds sent accidentally can be distributed as reward.
