# User might unexpectedly lose his funds upon exiting

## Summary
User might unexpectedly lose his funds upon exiting
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon exiting early using `earlyExitById()`, the system calculates a `penaltyAmount` based on how early you left and how much time was remaining until the unlock period. Due to how the protocol is designed, your unlock time is always in the future. For example, if the lock period is 30 days and you exit on the 15th day, your unlock time will be on the 30th day. If you exit on the 45th day however, your unlock time will not be on the 30th day but on the 60th. This can cause issues due to a network congestion, miner intentionally not mining the user's transaction in order to grief him or any other delays of the transaction which is a very regular occurrence.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. Bob wants to exit the system and calls `earlyExitByid()` on the 29th day (he has a lockup period of 30 days)
2. He is expecting a somewhat small penalty amount as he is just early by 1 day
3. Due to a network congestion and his transaction is delayed
4. His transaction is mined and he now owes a penalty amount for 30 days, meaning that he basically has to pay all of his funds as a penalty

Similar situation can occur when exiting late as well resulting in a user having his funds locked for another full lock period.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let the users specify an expected value for the remaining time until the lock period ends and revert if it is more than that.
