# Imprecise Penalty Calculation for Locked Positions Leading to Inaccurate Token Distribution

## Summary
The imprecise calculation of the penalty amount for locked positions can lead to significant inaccuracies in token distribution. This results in users paying less staking tokens than intended and the treasury receiving fewer tokens than designed. Over time, these errors accumulate, causing a substantial imbalance in the overall token distribution and undermining the integrity of the staking and treasury mechanisms. The net error and relative percentage error can become more significant, particularly when dealing with larger locked amounts, potentially leading to a notable shortfall in the treasury's token allocation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Solidity rounds down the result of an integer division, and because of that, it is always recommended to multiply before 
dividing to avoid that precision loss. In the case of a prior division over multiplication, the final result may face serious precision loss
as the first answer would face truncated precision and then multiplied to another integer.

The problem arises in the Lock's `calcPenaltyAmount()` part. It calculates the penalty amount for a locked position based on the remaining time until the scheduled unlock.
This function is called inside the function `earlyExitById()` which handles the early exit process, calculates penalties, updates balances, and transfers funds.
If we look at the penalty calculation process in detail we can see:

```Solidity
    function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }
```

As it is clear, there is a hidden division over multiplication in the computation of `penaltyFactor` variable. Dividing the lock period first and then multiplying by the amount results in a numerical rounding error.
This error results in users paying less in staking tokens, and the treasury receiving fewer tokens than intended in the case of `(lock.amount > penaltyAmount)`. 
This distribution error will accumulate over time, leading to a significant imbalance in token distribution.
You can run this code to see the difference between the results:

```Solidity
    function calcAccuratePenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyAmount = userLock.amount *
                ((unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction + (basePenaltyPercentage * lockPeriod)) /
                (lockPeriod * WHOLE);
        }
        else {
            penaltyAmount = userLock.amount *
                ((unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction + (basePenaltyPercentage * defaultRelockTime) /
                (defaultRelockTime * WHOLE);
        }
    }

    function test_precissionLoss() public {

        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(165e18, user1, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.setDefaultRelockTime(30);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 19); // warp 19 seconds into the future.
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // timePenaltyFraction: 35%
        // basePenaltyPercentage: 15%

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user1, 0);
        vm.prank(user1);
        uint actualPenalty = lock.calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
        uint accuratePenalty = lock.calcAccuratePenaltyAmount(lock);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        console.log("Current Implementation of penalty amount  ", actualPenalty);
        console.log("Accurate Implementation of penalty amount ", accuratePenalty);
    }
```

The result would be: 

(for these variables: 

`amount = 165 ether`, 

`basePenaltyPercentage = 15000`,

`timePenaltyFraction = 35000`,

`defaultRelockTime = 30`
)

```Solidity

     Current Implementation of penalty amount  : 61323900000000000000
     Accurate Implementation of penalty amount : 61325000000000000000

```
Thus, we can see that the actual implementation produces **less** penalty amount than what is intended to.
In this example, the net error is `1.1e16` or `0.011 ether` which can become more significant as the locked amount increases.

## Impact
The imprecise calculation of the penalty amount for locked positions leads to users paying fewer staking tokens than intended, and the treasury receiving fewer tokens than expected. This can result in significant inaccuracies in token distribution over time.

## Recommendation
Consider modifying the penalty amount calculation to prevent such precision loss and prioritize multiplication over division:

```diff
    function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

-            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
+            penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * (((unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction) + (basePenaltyPercentage * lockPeriod) /
+                (lockPeriod * WHOLE);
        }
        else {
-            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
+            penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * (((unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction) + (basePenaltyPercentage * defaultRelockTime) /
+                (defaultRelockTime * WHOLE);
        }

-        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
-        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }
```
