# In `Lock.sol` `setLockTypeInfo()` and `setTreasury()` should be restricted to be set once

## Summary
 `setLockTypeInfo()`,  `setTreasury()` should be restricted to be set only once when deploying the contract otherwise if called more than once will lead to unwanted reverts and further complications in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
 `setLockTypeInfo()` -  when called more than once with different values revert and cannot overwrite. 
Moreover the LockTypeInfo should be initialized once to prevent disruption of functionality when being deployed.

 `setTreasury()` - it is stated by the protocol that once initialized they have no intent to change it, In other for this invariant to be maintained this function must be set only once while deployed and to prevent future mistakes of re-setting to another address because once that is done it will lead to the re-route of rewards and further complications

## Impact
once these functions are called more than once they  throw reverts and stop functionality.
## Code Snippet
[`setLockTypeInfo()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L128-L143)
```solidity
    function setLockTypeInfo(
        uint256[] calldata _lockPeriod,
        uint256[] calldata _rewardMultipliers
    ) external onlyOwner {
        if (_lockPeriod.length != _rewardMultipliers.length)
            revert InvalidLockPeriod();
        delete lockPeriod;
        delete rewardMultipliers;
        uint256 length = _lockPeriod.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
            lockPeriod.push(_lockPeriod[i]);
            rewardMultipliers.push(_rewardMultipliers[i]);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }


        emit SetLockTypeInfo(lockPeriod, rewardMultipliers);
    }
```

[`setTreasury()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L163-L166)

```solidity
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
These Functions should have access controls that will restrict it to be set once and cannot be set again with different values.
