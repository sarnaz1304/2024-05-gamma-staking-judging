# Lock implemetation contract can be initialized by anyone and taken over by an attacker

## Summary
Lock implementation contract can be initialized by anyone and taken over by an attacker

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Lock.sol` contract it inherits Openzeppelinâ€™s Upgradeable contracts, uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with the initialize function

## Impact
The  `Lock.sol` implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disabling initializers in the constructor by invoking the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker helps mitigate these risk.
 ```diff
+     constructor() {
+     _disableInitializers()
+   }
```
