# User will receive more penalty on earlyExit near the edge of their lockPeriod/defaultRelockTime  if Transaction gets delayed leading to huge funds loss instead of zero penalty

## Summary
Currently , the way exit early penalty is being calculated is vulnerable to calculating more penalty 

for users who have initiated their early exit transaction near the edge of their lock maturity or lock period

i.e 2 to 3 blocks before their lock period completion.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the implementation of `calcPenaltyAmount`

which is used inside `earlyExitById` method to calculate the amount of tokens to deduct from user

for exiting early - before their lock period maturity.

```solidity
 function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }

```


This is used inside 

```solidity
    function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
       // SNIP
       uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
       //SNIP

```

the penalty amount is deducted from account's balance and rest of the tokens are given back to `msg.sender`.

However , if the transaction of early early exit is intiaited just few blocks before the user's lock's lock period 

and transaction is initiated and transaction is executed at `block.timestamp which is user's `lockPeriod+few seonds`

the user incurs loss of their funds.

Check earlyExitById method and we see the `unlockTime` of the lock is updated to 

```solidity
lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
```
the coolDownSecs are determined by the logic of `calcRemainUnlockPeriod`

```solidity
   function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```

```solidity
  
```
If the lock period of user is <= defaultLockPeriod
```solidity
 return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
```
above line will determine the amount of coolddown seconds.

But there's a flaw in this calculation.

Due to mod , 
if the time of transaction execution is just few seconds more than the user's own lock period , user will incur a huge loss

because it will result in huge cooldown seconds and hence huge penalty .

for example , suppose

```markdown
lockPeriod=10 seconds

defaultRelockPeriod = 10seconds

transaction execution of early exit = 5 seconds after lock initiation ( (block.timestamp - lockTime) = 5 seconds)

so cooldown seconds will be `10-(5)%10 = 10-5 = 5 seconds for cooldown and hence penalty

```
but what if the transaction is executed 1 second after the user's lock period ?


```markdown

lockPeriod=10 seconds

defaultRelockPeriod = 10seconds

transaction execution of early exit = 11 seconds after lock initiation ( (block.timestamp - lockTime) = 11 seconds)

so cooldown seconds will be `10-(11)%10 = 10-1 = 9 seconds for cooldown and hence penalty for 9 seconds instead of zero penalty.

```

because of this miscalculation , the users , who in fact has exited after the maturity of their lock , is getting penalty of huge amounts instead of getting zero penalty .


### PoC
Insert following in `tests/PenaltyCalculations.t.sol`

```solidity

 function testMorePenaltyTxDelayed() public {
        // stake 100 tokens
        bool attacker_mode = true;
        if (attacker_mode) {
            console.log("Assumption : TXs can be delayed");
        }
        else{
            console.log("Assumption : TXs is not delayed");
        }

        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0); // type 0 has 10 seconds lock period

        vm.prank(deployer);

        lock.setDefaultRelockTime(10);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5);

        // warp 5 seconds into the future.  Time remaining on user1's stake = 10 - (5) % 10 = 5 seconds
        // user1's lock duration is 10 secs and 5 seconds passed
        // timePenaltyFraction: 35%
        // basePenaltyPercentage: 15%
        // Formula: remainSecs / durationSecs * timePenaltyFraction + basePenaltyPercentage
        // 5 / 10 * 35% + 15% = 0.5*35% + 15% = 32.5%
        // penaltyAmount = 100 * 32.5% = 32.5% of 100 = 32.5 = 
        // User's total balance will be 900 + (100-32.5) = 967.5e18 or 9675e18


        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user1, 0);
        uint256 user1BalanceBefore = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);

        vm.prank(user1);
        // lock.earlyExitById(lockedBalance.lockId); transaction initiated ( but not executed )!!!

        // However transaction gets delayed due to network congestion and some other scenarios
        // transaction gets delayed by 6 seconds

        // ( being practical , if it was on mainnet , and transaction gets delayed by 3 blocks = 3*12= 48 seconds
        // and user has intitiated transaction 46 seconds before their actual lock period , scenario would have been same.abi

        // but imagine it takes 2 seconds for a block to be mined
        // and transaction got delayed 3 blocks , 2*3 = 6 seconds
        if (attacker_mode) {
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 6);
        }


        // Now transaction is executed 6 seconds into the future.
        
        //  Time remaining on user1's stake = 10 - (11) % 10 = 10 - 1  = 9 seconds
        // user1's lock duration is 10 secs and 9 seconds passed
        // timePenaltyFraction: 35%
        // basePenaltyPercentage: 15%
        // Formula: remainSecs / durationSecs * timePenaltyFraction + basePenaltyPercentage
        // 9 / 10 * 35% + 15% = 0.9*35% + 15% = 46.5 %
        // penaltyAmount = 100 * 46.5% = 46.5% of 100 = 46.5 
        // User's total balance will be 900 + (100-46.5) = 953.5e18 or 9535e17
        

        /**
         *
         * Transaction executes after 6 seconds delay
         */
        lock.earlyExitById(lockedBalance.lockId);

        uint256 user1BalanceAfter = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);
        // console.log("user1BalanceBefore", user1BalanceBefore);
        // console.log("user1BalanceAfter", user1BalanceAfter);

        
        if (attacker_mode) {
            assertEq(user1BalanceAfter, 9535e17);
            console.log("lost ", 9675e17 - 9535e17, " tokens");
        } else {
            assertEq(user1BalanceAfter, 9675e17);
            console.log("saved ", 9675e17 - 9535e17, " tokens");
        }
    }
```

### PoC output
In Our PoC , the user has lost comparatively 14e18  more tokens  than if transaction was to be executed on time 

If we pay attention , as user has technically exitted `after their lock period has elapsed` they should incur `no penalty`

so instead if getting 100 staked tokens back with some rewards , the user gets 53.5 tokens back losing a huge share of 

~ 47 tokens if the price of the staking token is  half of eth , 100$ , the loss incurred by the user is `4.7k$`

which is a huge loss for people operating from under developed countries .

## Impact
Loss of huge staking amount as penalty
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L323-L325
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Employ some mechanism to not allow early exits after lockPeriod time has passed 

instead user should be allowed to redeem their original staked amount plus any rewards accrued for their staking.
