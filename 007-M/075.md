# Single staked position can accrue rewards for all reward tokens

## Summary

Design of gamma multi staking reward contract could be problematic for reward rates and allow accrual of rewards without committing to dedicated locking period

## Vulnerability Detail

In gammas multi reward token staking contract, notice how rewards are computed as per the following:

$$ earnings = cumulateReward * lockedwithMultiplier - rewardDebt $$ 

$$ reward = earnings / 1e36 $$

1. Accumuluation of rewards are independent of reward duration - i.e. there are no dedicated reward cycles, staking simply assigns rewards based on a multiplier and duration staked

<br/>

2. Reward rates are not computed on a per token basis - It is instead directly dependent on a 1:1 ratio of amount of tokens notified within the `cumulatedReward` variable 



<br/>


This is as opposed to a traditional synthethix based reward staking contract. There, rewards are tracked on a per token basis. See Curve's [MultiRewards.sol](https://github.com/curvefi/multi-rewards/blob/master/contracts/MultiRewards.sol)

In gamma staking contract a single locked balance accrue rewards for all reward tokens with a indentical multiplier depending on duration locked. This results in the following impacts:

- It is very difficult for admins to control the intended reward rate per reward token. Since each reward token would have different valuations. This could eventually lead to overpayment/underpayment/unable to meet reward oof users.

<br/>

- This makes it easy for users to purposely set up expired locks, and since the auto relock mechanism defaults to the minimum `defaultRelockTime` period, that single locked balance can gain the maximum multiplier without locking for the full `lockPeriod` but instead just the minimum `defaultRelockTime` while still earning the same multiplier for all reward tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Utilized a per reward token to better control reward token rates as seen in curve `MultiRewards` contract [here](https://github.com/curvefi/multi-rewards/blob/master/contracts/MultiRewards.sol#L441-L449)
- Auto relocking mechanism need to be refactored
