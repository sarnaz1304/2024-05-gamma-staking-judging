# Loss of staking reward when calling the `Lock::exitLateById()` function more than once on a same lock

## Summary

An user could calling the `Lock::exitLateById()` function more than once, which result in misaccounting in `lockedWithMultiplier` and `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` variable then the user would not receive the correct amount of staking reward in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the normal flow of the process of staking, a user could use the `Lock::exitLateById()` function to stop staking. There is no restriction that would stop the user from calling the `Lock::exitLateById()` function more than once on a same lock. By doing that, the variables `lockedWithMultiplier` and `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` would be deduted more than once on a same lock. As a result, the user would not receive the amount of staking reward that they thought they had.

## Impact

The user would not receive the correct amount of staking reward since they calling the `Lock::exitLateById()` function more than once on a same lock.

## Proof of Concept

pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "./Setup.sol";

contract POC is Test, Setup {
    function testSub() public {
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);

        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);

        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 0);

        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.exitLateById(0);
        
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.exitLateById(0);

        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 100e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.getAllRewards();

        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.getAllRewards();

        console.log("user1 reward: %d", _rewardToken.balanceOf(user1));
        console.log("user2 reward: %d", _rewardToken.balanceOf(user2));
    }
}
```

Output
```bash
user1 reward: 0
user2 reward: 100000000000000000000
```

user1 and user2 should have receive 50e18 staking reward.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checking condition at the beginning of the `Lock::exitLateById()` function
```solidity
require(!lockedBalance.exitedLate, "...");
```
