# Preventing user to call `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` by increasing `lockCount` by `_stake()` onbehalfOf

## Summary
Attacker can call `_stake()` passing `onbehalfOf ` as victim address, for increasing the lockCount of the victim resulting in DoS on `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function call.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Since the protocol allows us to stake tokens on behalf of other user. This opens an attack vector, where an attacker can stake a minimal amount of staking token (GAMMA) on behalf of the victim, multiple times to increase the lockList significantly.
2. When the victim wants to withdraws all currently unlocked tokens for which the unlock time has passed, they make a call to `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` which loops over the entire lockList of the victim (this was incremented by making `_stake()` by the attacker), and also it has some state changing functions that uses gas units. 
3. The function call will eventually fail when the Tx runs out of gas due to excessive size of `lockList` . 

## Impact
The function call will eventually fail when the Tx runs out of gas due, preventing the victim from withdrawal of Unlocked Token as it goes out of gas before completing the loop execution which calculates the `totalUnlocked` tokens of the victim.
