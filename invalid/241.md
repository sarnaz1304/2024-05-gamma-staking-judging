# Attackers can restake unlocked tokens if stakingToken is an ERC777 token.


## Summary

The `withdrawUnlockedTokenById()` function does not comply with check-effect-interact pattern. The transfer of staking token happens before removing the lockId from the locklist, and the attacker can conduct an reentrancy attack to perform a restaking. The attacker would be able to withdraw and restake the staking token at the same time.

## Vulnerability Detail

First of all, the contest readme states that `The tokens we expect to interact with would be standard ERC-20 tokens. The staking token will be a standard ERC-20 token. The reward tokens will also be standard ERC-20 tokens.` And given ERC777 tokens also follow the standards of ERC20 tokens, so the protocol should handle security issues where the staking token is an ERC777 token.

The vulnerability lies in `withdrawUnlockedTokenById()`, where the stakingToken transfer happens before removing the lock from locklist. A reentrancy attack can be performed upon token transfer to call `restakeAfterLateExit()` to create a restake position, while also withdrawing the token.

```solidity
    function restakeAfterLateExit(uint256 id, uint256 typeIndex) external {
        // Retrieve the lock details for the specified ID.
>       LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id);
        require(lockedBalance.exitedLate, "This lock was not exited late or is ineligible for restaking.");

        uint256 newLockPeriod = lockPeriod[typeIndex]; // Get the new lock period based on the type index.
        uint256 currentLockPeriod = lockedBalance.lockPeriod;

        // Enforce that the new lock period must be valid based on the current conditions.
        if (currentLockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockedBalance.lockTime) < currentLockPeriod) {
            require(newLockPeriod >= currentLockPeriod, "New lock period must be greater than or equal to the current lock period");
        } else {
            require(newLockPeriod >= defaultRelockTime, "New lock period must be greater than or equal to the default relock time");
        }

        // Proceed to restake the funds using the new lock type.
 >      _stake(lockedBalance.amount, msg.sender, typeIndex, true);

        // Remove the old lock record to prevent any further operations on it.
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, id);

        emit RestakedAfterLateExit(msg.sender, id, lockedBalance.amount, typeIndex);
    }


    function withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        LockedBalance memory lockedBal = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details for the specified ID.
        if (lockedBal.unlockTime != 0 && lockedBal.unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
>           IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lockedBal.amount); // Transfers the unlocked amount to the user.
>           locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, id); // Removes the lock from the lock list.
            emit WithdrawUnlockedById(id, msg.sender, lockedBal.amount); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal of the unlocked tokens.
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Attackers can use reentrancy attack to restake and withdraw the staking token at the same time.

## Recommendation

Move the line `locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, id);` before transferring the staking token in function `withdrawUnlockedTokenById()`.
