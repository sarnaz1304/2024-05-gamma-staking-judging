# No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contracts From Attacker

## Summary
`_disableInitializers()` has to be called inside the constructor. This is done so that in the context of the logic contract the initializer is locked. Therefore any attacker will not able to call the `initalizer()` function in the state of the logic contract and perform any malicious activity.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
An attacker can take over an uninitialized implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent the implementation contract from being used, invoke the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to lock it when it is deployed automatically.

```javascript
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }
```
