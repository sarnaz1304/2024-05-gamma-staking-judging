# Attackers may receive rewards at zero cost

## Summary
In some cases, an attacker can profit by staking rewards immediately before they are transferred to the protocol and unstaking them immediately after staking.

## Vulnerability Detail
Follow the example below:
If the current lockedSupplyWithMultiplier=47k, the attacker detects that the protocol is about to transfer to a 50k reward. At this time, he was the first to trade, staking 1k, and chose to pledge for 365 days, with a multiple of 3. lockedSupplyWithMultiplier becomes 50k, and the attacker will receive a reward of 3k. Then the attacker exits early through the earlyExitById function and charges a maximum penalty of 50%, which is 0.5k. The attacker still made a profit of 2.5k.

Even if the actual profit is not so much, there is still room for arbitrage here.

## Impact
An attacker may receive a reward at zero cost, while the rewards for other users will be reduced.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _updateReward(address account) internal {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Determine the number of reward tokens.
        Balances storage bal = balances[account]; // Access the balance record for the user.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[token]; // Get the reward data for the token.

            rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token); // Update the rewards for the user based on what has been earned so far.
            rewardDebt[account][token] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier; // Update the reward debt based on the latest reward information.

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Limit the maximum single reward amount for transfer.
