# MinOut check should be added into the `Lock.earlyExitById` function

## Summary

When a user calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()`, some penalty is taken from his locked amount. However, users can lose large amount of stakingTokens unfairly when calling `Lock.earlyExitById()`, because of the vulnerability of the mechanism for calculating the amount od the penalty.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()`, some penalty is taken from his locked amount.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L313-L343

```solidity

        function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
                [...]
323         uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
            lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
325         uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
                [...]
            if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
                IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
                IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
                emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
            } else {
                IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
                emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
            }
        }
    
```

The amount of the penalty depends on the remaining time of the `lockPeriod`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L596-L607

```solidity
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
600     if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
602         return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
605         return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L569-L586

```solidity

        function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
            if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
            uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
            uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
            uint256 penaltyFactor;


576          if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

578             penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
            }
            else {
581             penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
            }

            // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
            penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
        }

```

If the user calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()` at the end of a `lockPeriod`, the penalty will be the minimum.
If the user calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()` just after the start of a `lockPeriod`, the penalty will be maximum.

However, the current mechanism for calculating penalty has some vulnerablity.

Consider the following scenarios:

The first scenario:
    1. Alice makes a transaction which calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()` near the end of the current `lockPeriod`.
    2. The transaction is delayed after the current `lockPeriod` ends and the next `lockedPeriod` begins.
    Then the maximum penalty is taken. In the worst case, she can take nothing.(if `lock.amount <= penaltyAmount`)

MinOut and Deadline can solve the vulnerability shown in the above scenario. But the deadline cannot solve the issue completely, becasue the `defaultRelockTime`, `LockTypeInfo` can be reset by the owner of the `Lock`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L111-L113

```solidity

        function setDefaultRelockTime(uint256 _defaultRelockTime) external onlyOwner {
112         defaultRelockTime = _defaultRelockTime;
        }

```

The second scenario:
    1. Alice makes a transaction which calls to `Lock.earlyExitById()` near the end of the current `lockPeriod`.
    2. `defaultRelockTime`(or `LockTypeInfo`) is reset and the amount of the penalty increases(may also decreases).

So, I think that `MinOut` parameter setting can solve this problem.

## Impact

Users can lose more amount of stakingTokens than expected when calling `Lock.earlyExitById()`.
