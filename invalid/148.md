# Incorrect accounting of Fee-On-Transfer ERC20

## Summary
In _stake function user specifies amount - the amount of staking token he wants to stake. The function uses the amount entered by the user to [fill in critical variables for the contract operation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L272-L277) - lockedSupply, lockedSupplyWithMultiplier etc.

The function does not take into account that if the stakingToken is a Fee-On-Transfer, the resulting amount may be less than the specified amount. Therefore, the real amount of funds on the contract may be less than the calculated amount. This can lead to DoS when returning staked tokens or to loss of staked tokens of other users (if the lack of tokens in payment is compensated by other tokens stored on the contract).

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC).
## Impact
Incorrect accounting of Fee-on-transfer tokens violates the logic of the contract, leading to the failure of some functions due to the lack of tokens for the return of staked tokens, or simply to incorrect compensation of tokens lost during accounting, at the expense of tokens of other users. In Discord, the team confirmed that the protocol may work with such tokens in the future, especially since such tokens may become USDT, USDC.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex,
        bool isRelock
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        if (typeIndex >= lockPeriod.length || amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();

        _updateReward(onBehalfOf);
        
        Balances storage bal = balances[onBehalfOf];

        bal.locked += amount;
        lockedSupply += amount;

        uint256 multiplier = rewardMultipliers[typeIndex];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier += amount * multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier += amount * multiplier;
        _updateRewardDebt(onBehalfOf);


        locklist.addToList(
            onBehalfOf, 
            LockedBalance({
                lockId: 0, // This will be set inside the addToList function
                amount: amount,
                unlockTime: 0, 
                multiplier: multiplier,
                lockTime: block.timestamp,
                lockPeriod: lockPeriod[typeIndex],
                exitedLate: false
            })
        );

        if (!isRelock) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
        }

        emit Locked(
            onBehalfOf,
            amount,
            balances[onBehalfOf].locked
        );
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use this count of tokens received

```solidity
before = IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(
                address(this)
 );
IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
after= IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(
                address(this)
 );
amount = after - before
```
