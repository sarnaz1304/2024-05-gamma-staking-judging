# Miners can manipulate the block.timestamp to reduce the penalty amount when unlocking tokens early

## Summary

Miners can manipulate `block.timestamp` to reduce the penalty amount when unlocking tokens early. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists in the `calcPenaltyAmount` function of the `Lock` contract. The function uses `block.timestamp` to calculate the remaining time until the unlock period ends. Since miners have the ability to adjust the `block.timestamp` within a small range, they can manipulate it to reduce the penalty calculated for early withdrawals.

## Impact

By manipulating `block.timestamp`, a malicious miner can reduce the penalty amount for an early withdrawal of locked tokens. Although the impact of a single manipulation might be small, repeated or large-scale exploitation can lead to significant financial losses for the contract and other users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L569C4-L586C6

```solidity
function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
    if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
    uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
    uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
    uint256 penaltyFactor;

    if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
        penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
    } else {
        penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
    }

    // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
    penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
}
```

## Recommendation
Replace the use of `block.timestamp` with `block.number`
