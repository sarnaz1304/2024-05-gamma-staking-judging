# Ability to late exit same lock multiple times will lead to locked user stakes in contract

## Summary
In `exitLateById` there no checks preventing the user from late exiting the same lock multiple times leading to his stakes being locked without being able to recover them.
## Vulnerability Detail
here is a POC demonstrating how it will get users stakes locked
```solidity=
function test_poc_lockrewards() public {
        

        // user 1 stakes 2 stakes
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 1);

        // Distributing rewards to the staking contract
         vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 600e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        
        // user1 get his rewards
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.getAllRewards();     

        // user 1 double lateExit his stake 
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.exitLateById(0);
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.exitLateById(0);

        // user 1 can't exit his second stake after this leading to it being locked
        vm.expectRevert();
        lock.exitLateById(1);   

    }
```
## Impact
Loss of stakes funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check that only allows locks with exited late == false to be processed by exiteLatebyId
