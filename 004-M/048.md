# `Lock.calcRemainUnlockPeriod` fails when `lockPeriod` is not a multiple of `defaultRelockTime`

## Summary

> Upon expiry of any lock time, the positions are automatically relocked for the duration of the lesser of the original lock time or the default lock time. 

The calculation that tries to achieve this has a flaw - it doesn't properly align the computed value to the time *after* the lockPeriod. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the scenario where the lock period is longer than the default lock time, the quoted sentence from above can be rephrased to
> Upon expiry of any lock time, the positions are automatically relocked for the duration of the default lock time. 

So, if we have the following settings: 
 - lockPeriod = 50 days
 - defaultLockTime = 30 days

On the 51st day the user must wait 29 days before they can withdraw their locked balance. This is because the initial lockPeriod of 50 days has passed and the staked tokens were relocked for another 30 days, 1 of which has already passed.

Let's have a look at the code that's responsible for the correctness of this calculation.
```solidity
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```
The `else` statement will be executed, so the days the users will actually wait will be equal to `defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime`

If we replace the variables with the values from the above example, we get:
`30 - (51) % 30` = $30 - 21 = 9$

> [!CAUTION]
> We expected 29, but received 9

This will result in the user withdrawing earlier than they are supposed to, or paying less penalty if early exit was used. 

## Impact
Messed up relocking calculation when the `lockPeriod` is not a multiple of `defaultRelockTime`.

## Recommendation
Align the time computations properly:
```diff
-            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
+            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime - lockPeriod) % defaultRelockTime;
```
