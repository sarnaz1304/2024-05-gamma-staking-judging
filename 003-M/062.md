# Lack of a deadline in the `exitLateById` function can cause an unexpected increase in unlock time and a loss of potential future rewards.


## Summary
A validator can hold the transaction until it becomes disadvantageous for the user. A deadline is a useful tool to ensure that your transaction cannot be 'saved for later' to manipulate results, which can be disadvantageous for the user. Without this check, a validator can delay adding the transaction until it incurs the maximum disadvantage for the user.


The `exitLateById` function contains no deadline parameter. Because of this, the transaction remains valid indefinitely, and `coolDownSecs` can vary depending on when the transaction is executed.

If a user wants to execute the transaction before the lock period but it gets executed after the lock period, then `coolDownSecs` will be different. This will prevent the user from withdrawing their staked tokens at expected time and result in a loss of rewards because then ID will have ExitedLate set to true. 



## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
Let's say the `lock period` is 30 days and the `defaultRelockTime` is also 30 days. The user decides to exit late by calling `exitLateById` just before `10 seconds` remain in completing the `30 days` period.

The user sends the transaction to call `exitLateById` with `10 seconds` left, but the transaction gets executed `1 second` after the lock period ends due to the validator. As a result, the new unlock time will be `30 days - 1` due to the relock, and the user will not receive future rewards.


## Impact

Due to this, the user will not receive future rewards and will be unable to withdraw the staked tokens for a longer period of time.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }
        ...
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
