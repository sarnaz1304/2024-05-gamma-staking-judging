# Precision loss in `Lock.calcPenaltyAmount()`

## Summary
Stakers pay less penalty for early exit because of divison before multiplication in [Lock.calcPenaltyAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L569-L586).

## Vulnerability Detail
When stakers exit early, they need to pay a penalty fee that is calculated as follows:
```solidity
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
```
There is a hidden divison before multiplication here.

If we expand the last line, we get
`userLock.amount * [(unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage] / WHOLE`

We can see how `timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod` will be executed before the expression gets multiplied by `userLock.amount`. This will result in a precision loss and the whole `penaltyAmount` will be less than expected.
## Impact
Stakers can exit early and not pay the whole penalty fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The formula can be rewritten, so it first multiplies and divides after that
```solidity
       uint256 divideBy;
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            divideBy = lockPeriod;
        }
        else {
            divideBy = defaultRelockTime;
        }
        penaltyAmount = (userLock.amount* basePenaltyPercentage + userLock.amount * (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / divideBy) / WHOLE;
```
