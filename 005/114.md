# Inability to set staking token address

## Summary
The setStakingToken function has a bug in the condition that checks if `_stakingToken == address(0)` and if `stakingToken != address(0)).` It would be impossible to set a new staking token address when stakingToken is set once because it would revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
With the current condition below, the function will revert if the new staking token address to be set is non-zero, and it will also revert if the stakingToken address is not zero. This behavior is the opposite of what is intended. Here's why.

stakingToken is a public variable declared here:

  `address public override stakingToken;`
  
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L63
  
Now in the setStakingToken function, the function would revert if `stakingToken` is not zero:

` if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L153C8-L153C93

When stakingToken is set the first time, subsequent setting of stakingToken would be impossible.

## Impact
Inability to set new staking token address after setting the first one

## Code Snippet
`if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert only if new token is zero address and if new token already exists
