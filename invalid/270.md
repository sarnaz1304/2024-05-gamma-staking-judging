# The function ```earlyExitById``` will always revert if the ```owner!=Lock.sol```.

## Summary

There is a modifier ```onlyOwner``` in the function ```removeFromList``` of LockList.sol meaning it can be only called by the owner. However, it is called by the Lock.sol in the function ```earlyExitById``` and if ```owner!=Lock.sol``` it will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
```onlyOwner``` modifier checks if the msg.sender is the owner address, if not it will revert the function call. 

In the function ```earlyExitById``` of Lock.sol there is a call to LockList.sol's ```removeFromList``` function:

```  locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockId);```


The msg.sender in that call will be Lock.sol in the context of LockList.sol. 

If ```owner!=Lock.sol``` , ```removeFromList``` function and subsequently ```earlyExitById``` will revert.

The owner address is a team multisig according to the  contest README not Lock.sol. Therefore, calls to ```earlyExitById``` will always revert.


## Impact
Users unable to cancel their stake early and one of the core functions of the protocol not working.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a modifier to the ```removeFromList``` function in LockList.sol so that the calls from the Lock.sol are also allowed.
