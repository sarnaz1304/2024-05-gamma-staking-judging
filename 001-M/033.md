# Inefficient looping logic in the `Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function can lead to unintended and unpredictable behaviors.

## Summary

The `while` loop implementation in the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function is suboptimal.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `while` loop implementation in the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function is problematic. On the first loop iteration, it retrieves all the locks of the caller by calling the `locklist.getLocks()` function at `L416`. In this function call, the third parameter is set to `lockCount`, which represents the total number of the caller's locks, instead of the `limit`. This means that the first loop iteration will fetch all of the caller's locks, making the subsequent loop iterations unnecessary.

However, the current logic still proceeds to loop `lockCount / 10` times due to the condition at `L424`. From the second loop iteration onwards, it will fetch unnecessary arrays that have a length but no actual data. This inefficient looping behavior can potentially lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) issue due to excessive gas consumption.

```solidity
    function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
        uint256 page;
        uint256 limit;
        uint256 totalUnlocked;
        
        while (limit < lockCount) {
416         LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }

            limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
            page++;
        }

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
        emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
    }
```

## Impact

The improper looping mechanism can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) issue due to excessive gas consumption.
