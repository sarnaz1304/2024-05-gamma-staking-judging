# Precision loss in `Lock::_getReward` leading to incorrect `reward` distribution

## Summary
The [`Lock::_getReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L538-L559) function  has a precision loss issue due to the handling of reward amounts, which can lead to incorrect reward distribution to users. This occurs because rewards are scaled by `1e36` for precision but not properly adjusted when transferring rewards, causing users to receive less than their due rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the  [`Lock::_getReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L538-L559) function, reward amounts are handled with high precision (scaled by `1e36`). However, when transferring the rewards to users, the scaling factor is applied incorrectly, leading to precision loss and users receiving less than they should.

[Lock.sol#L538-L559](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L538-L559)
- The function calculates the reward for each user by adding the accrued rewards and then scales down by `1e36` before transferring.
- The line `rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36;` deducts the reward from the contract's balance with the scaling factor applied, but this can introduce precision loss due to integer division.

## Impact
Users will consistently receive slightly less than their earned rewards, which can accumulate over time and lead to significant losses, affecting the fairness and accuracy of the reward distribution mechanism.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make these changes on  [`Lock::_getReward`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L538-L559) function:

```diff
function _getReward(
    address _user,
    address[] memory _rewardTokens
) internal whenNotPaused {
    uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

        uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
        if (reward > 0) {
            rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
-           rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.
+           rewardData[token].balance -= reward; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance without scaling down.

-           IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
-           rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
-           emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
+           uint256 scaledReward = reward / 1e36; // Scale down the reward here.
+           IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, scaledReward); // Transfer the scaled reward to the user.
+           rewardPaid[_user][token] += scaledReward; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
+           emit RewardPaid(_user, token, scaledReward); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
        }
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
