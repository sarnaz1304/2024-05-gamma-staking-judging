# `Lock::exitLateById` allows early Exits without penalty

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`Lock::exitLateById`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349-L371) function is intended to allow users to withdraw their locked tokens after the lock period has ended without incurring a penalty. However, the function does not check whether the lock period has ended before allowing the exit. This oversight permits users to exit their locked positions prematurely, leading to inconsistent states and potentially incorrect handling of user balances and rewards.

### Proof of Concept:
1. User A stakes 100 tokens with a lock period of 30 days.
2. After 20 days, User A decides to exit late by calling `exitLateById`.
3. The function `exitLateById` does not check whether the lock period of 30 days has ended.
4. The function updates the unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period, allowing User A to exit after only 20 days instead of 30.
5. User A exits and withdraws their tokens without incurring the intended penalty for early exit.

## Impact
Allowing users to exit prematurely without checking if the lock period has ended leads to:
- Potentially incorrect handling of user balances.
- Users bypassing intended penalties, affecting the fairness and security of the staking mechanism.

## Code Snippet
The affected code lies in the `exitLateById` function:

- [`Lock.sol#L349-L371`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349-L371)
```solidity
/// @notice Allows a user to execute a late exit from a lock by specifying the lock ID, updating unlock times and reducing locked balances.
/// @dev This function adjusts the unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period, updates the locked balances, flags the lock as exited late, and logs the exit.
/// @param id The unique identifier of the lock from which the user wishes to exit late.
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
    _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

    LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

    // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
    uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
    locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

    // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
    uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
    lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
    Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
    bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

    locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

    _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

    emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent users from exiting prematurely without penalty, add a check in the `exitLateById` function to ensure that the lock period has ended before allowing an exit.

```diff
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
    _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

    LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

+    // Check if the lock period has ended
+    require(block.timestamp >= lockedBalance.lockTime + lockedBalance.lockPeriod, "Lock period has not ended");

    // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
    uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
    locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

    // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
    uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
    lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
    Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
    bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

    locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

    _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

    emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
}
```
