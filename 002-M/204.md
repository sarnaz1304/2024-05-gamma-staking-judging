# User can call `exitLateById()` multiple times for the same lockId to shorten his unlock period


## Summary

The function `exitLateById()` is used for users to execute a late exit for a lockId, and the unlock time will be precalculated. However, users can call `exitLateById()` again if the `defaultRelockTime` changes to his benefit, potentially resulting in a shorter unlock period.

## Vulnerability Detail

The core issue is `exitLateById()` function does not check whether the lock has already been exitedLate-ed or not. The user can call this function for a lock that has already been exitedLate-ed, and the unlock time will be recalculated. Since the unlock time is dependent on a changeable `defaultRelockTime` variable, the user may toy with this function to achieve a shorter unlock period, which is unexpected.

An example of user shortening his unlock period is:

1. User stakes for 300 days, and the `defaultRelockTime` is 60 days.
2. 310 days has passed. User calls `exitLateById()` for this lock. The remaining unlock period is 50 days.
3. Admin changes `defaultRelockTime` to 30 days.
4. User calls `exitLateById()` again, and the unlock period will be recalculated and shortened to 20 days.

Note that the `defaultRelockTime` does not have to always decrease in order for users to achieve a shorter unlock period. For example, user originally stakes for 300 days, and `defaultRelockTime` is 50. At day 355, the remaining unlock period would be 45 days, but if `defaultRelockTime` is changed to 60, the remaining unlock period would be only 5 days.

Also note that though the user's `lockedWithMultiplier` would double-decrease due to calling `exitLateById()` multiple times. The core issue here is that users can toy with the `exitLateById()` mechanism to achieve a shorter unlock period, which should be unexpected.

```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
>       uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }

    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Users can toy with the `exitLateById()` mechanism to achieve a shorter unlock period.

## Recommendation

Add a check that the lock entering `exitLateById()` does not have `.exitedLate == true`.
