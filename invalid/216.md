# Potential Loss of User Funds Due to Improper Validation in Lock::stake() Function

## Summary
User funds could inadvertently become stuck in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Lock::stake()` external function, which can be called by anyone, there is no validation for the *onBehalfOf* parameter. This can lead to the following issue:
<br>
1. If a user mistakenly calls the function Lock::stake(10 ether, address(0), 0), the tokens will be irretrievably stuck in the protocol, as neither the user nor anyone else would be able to recover them.

## Impact
Users risk losing their tokens permanently.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add a validation check for the onBehalfOf parameter to ensure it is not zero. If the parameter value is zero, revert the transaction:
```solidity
+    require(onBehalfOf != 0);
```

2. Consider separating the function into two distinct functions: one for stakingAccount == msg.sender and another for stakingAccount != msg.sender, with additional warnings for users who call the latter function.
