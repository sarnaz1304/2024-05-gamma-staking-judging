# Off by one issue in unlock period calculation will cause issue.

## Summary

There is off by one issue in `calcRemainUnlockPeriod(...)`. So if the user exit at the exact end of the lock period, his unlock period will set after 30 days. But when he does the same thing just 1 second before, his unlock time will be set after 2 seconds only. In the first case, user didn't enter the second cycle but his unlock time got set to after 30 days.

## Vulnerability Detail

A user should be able to withdraw immediately if he didn't enter the next round, but he still had to keep his amount for extra 30 days and will still not receive any reward.

## Impact

User will have to put his token for the extra time.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L576

```solidity
    function test_stake7() public {
        // Initial staking by three users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);

        uint256 balanceBefore = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);
        skip(30 days - 1);
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.exitLateById(0);

        LockedBalance memory lockUser1 = lockList.getLock(user1, 0);
    }

    function test_stake8() public {
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 0);

        skip(30 days);
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.exitLateById(0); 
        LockedBalance memory lockUser2 = lockList.getLock(user2, 0); 
    }
```

After running the first test we will see that user's unlock time is set after 2 seconds, but in second case it was set after 30 days. Only after doing the same thing in just one second.
