# Fee on transfer tokens can leads to incorect total reward paid

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The primary concern with the original `_getReward `function is the implicit reliance on the `safeTransfer` function from the SafeERC20 library to ensure that token transfers are successful. While `safeTransfer` does provide robust checks and will revert if the transfer fails, there is no explicit verification of the contract's token balance before and after the transfer. This can make it difficult to debug issues related to insufficient contract balances or unexpected token behavior.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to enhance the `_getReward` function by including explicit balance checks before and after the token transfer. These checks provide additional security and clearer error messages, which can significantly aid in debugging and ensuring the reliability of the reward distribution process
