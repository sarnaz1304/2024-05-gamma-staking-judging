# User can receive more rewards by exploiting the protocol design

## Summary

The current protocol design determines that when the user's lock time is reached, he/she will receive more rewards than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current protocol design is:

“Upon expiry of any lock time, the positions are automatically relocked for the duration of the lesser of the original lock time or the default lock time.”

However, the relocking will not change the multiplier. In other words, the subsequent automatic relocking multiplier will be higher than it should be. For example, the user locks a staking for 120 days, where the multiplier is 2. After 120 days, the lock will automatically enter a 30-day lock with a  multiplier of 1. However, under the current protocol design, the coefficient is still 2. Therefore, users will continue to receive more rewards, and its shorter locking time determines that the unlocking will be more flexible (within 30 days instead of 120 days).

## Impact

User can receive more rewards by exploiting the protocol design.

## Recommendation

When the lock time is reached, its multiplier should be updated.
