# `calcRemainUnlockPeriod` reflects exact remain unlock period, so user may wait more time than expected due to some situations like network network latencies and validator hardware/connectivity variations.

## Summary
`calcRemainUnlockPeriod` calculates the remaining unlock period based on either the lock's specific period or the default relock time, depending on which is relevant.
If there is no block on exactly 30 days after user stakes,  then user may wait 30 days more for call to exitLateById.
Also, user can pay more penalty for early exit If there is no block on exactly 30 days after user stakes.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calculates the remaining unlock period based on either the lock's specific period or the default relock time, depending on which is relevant.
```solidity
function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```
In above code, if (block.timestamp - lockTime) is not exactly times of lockPeriod, and slightly greater than n times of lockPeriod, then user may wait about lockedPeriod.

It is not possible to predict or guarantee that a new block will be generated exactly 30 days after the current block's timestamp on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, or Optimism.
Fixed Block Intervals:
After the Merge, Ethereum has a fixed block interval of approximately 12 seconds (or multiples of 12 seconds in rare cases). This means that new blocks are produced at a consistent cadence, but the exact timing cannot be predicted precisely 30 days in advance due to potential minor variations.
Variable Block Times on Layer 2 Solutions:
Layer 2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon PoS, and Polygon zkEVM have their own independent block times that differ from Ethereum mainnet. While they target specific intervals (e.g., 1 minute for Arbitrum, 2 seconds for Optimism), the actual block production times can vary slightly due to network conditions and consensus mechanisms.
Unpredictable Network Conditions:
Factors like network congestion, validator performance, and potential changes in protocol parameters during the 30-day period can affect the actual block production times, making it impossible to pinpoint the exact timestamp of a future block.
Probabilistic Nature of Blockchains:
Blockchains are probabilistic systems, and while they aim for consistent block intervals, there is always a degree of variability and uncertainty in the exact timing of future blocks. 

## Impact
User may not withdraw at expectation time, or pay more penalty than expected.

## Recommendation
If there is slightly bias from lockPeriod, it should be allowed in `calcRemainUnlockPeriod`.
