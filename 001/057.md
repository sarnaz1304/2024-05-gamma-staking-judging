# Calling the `exitLateById` function twice with the same `ID` mistakenly causes a loss of staking tokens and future rewards.

## Summary
The `exitLateById` function doesn't check if an `ID` has already exited late. As a result, calling `exitLateById` twice with the same `ID` can cause a loss of staking tokens and future rewards.


## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:
A user has staked with two IDs: the first `ID` with `300` tokens and the second `ID` with `400` tokens, and the multiplier is `1`. The `lockedWithMultiplier` and `locked` values will both be `700`.

When the user calls `exitLateById` the first time with the first `ID`, both `lockedWithMultiplier` and `locked` will become `400`, indicating that the user can withdraw the remaining `400` tokens for the second `ID`.

If the user mistakenly calls `exitLateById` again with the first `ID`, both `lockedWithMultiplier` and `locked` will incorrectly become `100`.

If the user wants to withdraw the second `ID`, the `exitLateById` function will revert because `lockedWithMultiplier` and `locked` are now `100`, while the amount for the second `ID` is `400` and as we know `100 - 400` will revert.

As a result, the user will never be able to withdraw those `400` tokens and will only receive rewards for the `100` tokens that are stuck.

## Impact
It can cause the loss of staked tokens and potential rewards.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349    
```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We should check that lockedBalance.exitedLate should be false.
