# Uninitialized local variables

## Summary
`Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken::limit` is a local variable never initialized

## Vulnerability Detail
The uninitialized local variable `limit` in the `Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function indicates a potential issue in the code. Specifically, the `limit` variable is declared but not assigned a value before it is used in the while loop condition `while (limit < lockCount)`. This can lead to unpredictable behavior because the initial value of `limit` is undefined, which means the loop might not execute as intended.

## Impact
Without initializing `limit`, the while loop's behavior is unpredictable. Depending on the initial value of `limit`, the loop might not iterate at all, or it might enter an infinite loop if `limit` starts higher than lockCount. This kind of bug can lead to logic errors in the contract's operation. For example, if the intention was to process a fixed number of items per iteration (as suggested by incrementing limit by 10), starting with an uninitialized value could result in processing fewer or more items than expected.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, `limit` should be initialized to a sensible starting value before entering the loop. Based on the context, it seems like `limit` is intended to track the number of items processed in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, initializing `limit` to 0 or another appropriate value at the start of the function would ensure consistent and predictable behavior.
