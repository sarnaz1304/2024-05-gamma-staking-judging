# _updateReward is not updated in the _getReward function

## Summary
In the function ```_getReward``` the ```_updateReward``` is called before the reward is transferred and not called after it is transferred.
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue mentioned above does not update the reward given so a user could call ```_getReward``` multiple times to get more rewards than he should get
POC
add this lines in withdraw.t.sol after the last assertEq

```solidity
vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300e18);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.getAllRewards();
```
## Impact
The protocol can loose all available rewards to one user.
