# Missing size check of `typeIndex` parameter on `Lock::restakeAfterLateExit` could disallow a user from restaking funds after existing late by mistake

## Summary

Missing size check of `typeIndex` parameter on `Lock::restakeAfterLateExit` could disallow a user from restaking funds after existing late by mistake

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `Lock::restakeAfterLateExit` enables a user to restake funds after existing late by mistake. However, there is no safeguard on the value of `typeIndex`. If the later is bigger than the length of the array `lockPeriod`, it could lead to `array out-of-bounds access` panic, hence, disallowing the user from finishing the restaking action.

## Impact

A user providing a wrong lock type index could see his restaking action failed, e.g. not be able to `restakeAfterLateExit` if he weren't aware of the wrong value put in the `typeIndex` parameter.


## Code Snippet

Scenario:
- User1 wants to restake the same amount for a new lock period, but he puts the wrong lock index value
- He can't restake

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```javascript

function testUserACantRestakeAfterLateExitWithTooBigTypeIndex() public {
    // User A stakes initially
    vm.prank(user1);
    lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0); // User A stakes with the first lock type

    uint256 initialLockId = 0; // Assuming lockId starts at 0 and increments

    // Advance time to simulate a late exit scenario
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days); // Simulate passing 15 days

    vm.prank(user1);    
    lock.exitLateById(initialLockId);
    
    // Fetch the lock details after late exit
    LockedBalance memory lockedBalanceAfterExit = lock.locklist().getLockById(user1, initialLockId);
    console.log("exitedLate flag:  ", lockedBalanceAfterExit.exitedLate);
    assertTrue(lockedBalanceAfterExit.exitedLate, "exitLateById should have changed exitedLate to true");

    // Now User A wants to restake the same amount for a new lock period
    vm.prank(user1);
    lock.restakeAfterLateExit(initialLockId, 3); // NOTE: the typeIndex value should be 0, instead of 3

}

```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

Consider adding the following modifications:

1. In the file `ILock.sol`, add the new error definition:

```diff

+   error LockTypeIndexBiggerThanLockPeriodLength();

```

- In the file `Lock.sol`, add the condition check:

```diff

function restakeAfterLateExit(uint256 id, uint256 typeIndex) external {
        // Retrieve the lock details for the specified ID.
        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id);
        require(lockedBalance.exitedLate, "This lock was not exited late or is ineligible for restaking.");
+       if (typeIndex >= lockPeriod.length) revert LockTypeIndexBiggerThanLockPeriodLength();
        uint256 newLockPeriod = lockPeriod[typeIndex]; 
...
}

```
