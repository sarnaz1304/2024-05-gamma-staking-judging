# `block.timestamp - lockedBalance.lockTime == lockedBalance.lockPeriod` - this case was not handled while calculating remaining unlock period which results in too high penalty charge when `earlyExitById()` is called at lockPeriod timestamp

## Summary
The `Lock::calcRemainUnlockPeriod()` does not has a check whether the time difference between lockTime & block.timestamp is equal to the lockPeriod (30 seconds as per test setUp)  or not, so when  `earlyExitById()` is called at lockPeriod timestamp the penalty will be charged with very high amount.
## Vulnerability Detail

>  **To catch the penalty amount I added a storage variable named _penaltyAmount`**
> ```solidity
> uint public _penaltyAmount;
> function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
> /// ...codes
> uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
>         lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;        
>         uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
>         _penaltyAmount = penaltyAmount;   // here is how it is happening
> /// ...codes
> }
> ```

As per the current logic of contract the penalties  for respected timestamps are these:
For,  lockTime + 5 seconds = 441660000000000000000 = 441.660000000000000000 staking token
        lockTime + 10 seconds = 383330000000000000000 =  383.330000000000000000 staking token
        lockTime + 15 seconds = 325000000000000000000 =  325 staking token
        lockTime + 20 seconds = 266660000000000000000 =  266.660000000000000000 staking token
        lockTime + 25 seconds = 208330000000000000000 =  208.330000000000000000 staking token
        lockTime + 29 seconds =  161660000000000000000 =  161.660000000000000000 staking token

As you can see as much the timestamp goes forward to lockPeriod the penalty amount is going significantly downwards. But let see the penalty amount at lockPeriod timestamp i.e lockTime + 30 secs:
 lockTime + 30 seconds = 500000000000000000000 = 500 staking token
As you saw the amount is huge.
The reason behind this is how remaining unlock period is calculated  in `calcRemainUnlockPeriod()`, let see the function:
```solidity
        function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```
Here if you notice in this line:
```solidity
if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
```
you will see that here the case was not handled when `(block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) == lockPeriod)`, for this reason we are getting the penalty charge so high.

### POC
Add a storage variable with name *_penaltyAmount* to hold the penalty at this variable, as I shown at the begining of this report.
Now paste this test case in Deposit.t.sol file:
```solidity
function test_wrongPenaltyLogic() public {
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 60e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(1000e18, user1, 2);
        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lockList.getLockById(user1, 0);
        // @note you can change the timestamp like skip(5), skip(10) to see the penalty charge at that timestamp
        skip(30);  // @audit  we are at lockPeriod timestamp i.e lockTime + 30 seconds
        assertEq(block.timestamp - lockedBalance.lockTime, lockedBalance.lockPeriod);
        Balances memory balances = lock.getBalances(user1);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        lock.earlyExitById(0);
        console.log("Penalty amount:", lock._penaltyAmount()); // @audit calling the storage variable which was added by us
        console.log("tressury balance: ", _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock.treasury())));
    }
```
Logs:
```soldiity
Penalty amount: 500000000000000000000
  tressury balance:  500000000000000000000
```
## Impact
Staker will be charged with very high penalty amount if  `earlyExitById()` is called at lockPeriod timestamp.

## Recommendation
Change the logic of `calcRemainUnlockPeriod()` from current to this:
```solidity
function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;  
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod; 
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {  
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;  
        } else if((block.timestamp - lockTime) == lockPeriod){   // @audit this 'else if' part added
            return 0;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime; 
        }
    }
```
After adding the `else if` part in the function if you run the same test you will get:
```solidity
Penalty amount: 150000000000000000000
  tressury balance:  150000000000000000000
```
i.e   penalty amount for lockTime + 30 seconds = 150000000000000000000 = 150 staking token. It seems reasonable because for lockTime + 29 seconds the penalty charge was = 161.660000000000000000 staking token
