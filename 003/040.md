# When a user stakes, if setLockTypeInfo happens to be called, unexpected staking will occur.

## Summary

When a user stakes, if `setLockTypeInfo` happens to be called, unexpected staking will occur.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the user needs to stake, he/she will choose the lock time and rewardMultiplier of the stake, which is determined by the parameter `typeIndex`. However, one situation is that when the user decides to stake, the owner happens to set the locktime and rewardMultiplier (using function setLockTypeInfo), which will lead to unexpected stake. For example, user wants to stake for 30 days. However, after changing the `lockPeriod` , the stake locktime may come to 120 days.

## Impact

Unexpected staking may happen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol should be in the `paused` state when the owner wants to call setLockTypeInfo.

```solidity
function setLockTypeInfo(
    uint256[] calldata _lockPeriod,
    uint256[] calldata _rewardMultipliers
) external onlyOwner whenPaused {
```
