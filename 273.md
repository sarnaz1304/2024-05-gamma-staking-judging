# `stake` function will always reverts on Arbitrum when `stakingToken` is WETH

## Summary
According to README,
> The tokens we expect to interact with would be standard ERC-20 tokens. The staking token will be a standard ERC-20 token. The reward tokens will also be standard ERC-20 tokens.

Quoting the sponsor's [comment](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1241042575381762168/1241158651138408589) on the contest's public Discord channel
> So the staking token and the reward tokens will be standard ERC-20 tokens.  No rebasing or fee-on-transfer.  We may however allow for 6 decimal tokens like USDC and USDT.
In practice, it will be staking GAMMA, and earn WETH and/or GAMMA.  But we could allow for other standard ERC-20 tokens that are neither rebasing or fee-on-transfer.

Quoting the README again,
>  On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM

When a user stakes for the first time, the staking token is sent from the user to the Lock.sol contract where the staker earns rewards according to the length of the lock period.

## Vulnerability Detail
During staking, when **isRelocked** is to **false** (by default), the staking token is transferred to the `Lock` contract.
```solidity
File: Lock.sol

294:      if (!isRelock) {
295:            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransferFrom(
296:               msg.sender,
297:                address(this),
298:                amount
299:            );
300:        }
```
The token transfer is done using the `safeTransferFrom` method. This works fine on most chains (Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC) which use the standard `WETH9` contract that handles the case `src == msg.sender`:
```solidity
WETH9.sol

if (src != msg.sender && allowance[src][msg.sender] != uint(- 1)) {
            require(allowance[src][msg.sender] >= wad);
            allowance[src][msg.sender] -= wad;
        }
```
The problem is that the WETH implementation on Arbitrum uses [a different contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8b194beae1d3e0788a1a35173978001acdfba668#code), and does not have this `src == msg.sender` handling.

## Impact
Because the Lock never approves itself to spend `WETH`, the token transfer line 295 will always revert on `Arbitrum` when using `WETH` as the `stakingToken`.
