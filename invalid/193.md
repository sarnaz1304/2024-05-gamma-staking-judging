# Missing `whenNotPaused`

## Summary
There is no `whenNotPaused` in `restakeAfterLateExit` due to which the user will still be able to stake even when `Owner` pauses the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The good practice among all staking protocols where contracts are pausable is to:
 - Stop the incoming stream of funds i.e is staking in the protocol.
 - Allow all users to retrieve their funds if they want to.
>[!IMPORTANT]
In emergency cases, if the above practice isn't followed, it could easily lead to various problems.
Now in `restakeAfterLateExit` user naturally shouldn't be able to restake as `_stake` is using `whenNotPaused` but this could be easily bypassed by using an MEV bot watching for owner methods in mempool making protocol prone to different issues as per the emergency situation.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id);
        require(lockedBalance.exitedLate, "This lock was not exited late or is ineligible for restaking.");

        uint256 newLockPeriod = lockPeriod[typeIndex]; // Get the new lock period based on the type index.
        uint256 currentLockPeriod = lockedBalance.lockPeriod;

        // Enforce that the new lock period must be valid based on the current conditions.
        if (currentLockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockedBalance.lockTime) < currentLockPeriod) {
            require(newLockPeriod >= currentLockPeriod, "New lock period must be greater than or equal to the current lock period");
        } else {
            require(newLockPeriod >= defaultRelockTime, "New lock period must be greater than or equal to the default relock time");
        }

        // Proceed to restake the funds using the new lock type.
        _stake(lockedBalance.amount, msg.sender, typeIndex, true);

        // Remove the old lock record to prevent any further operations on it.
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, id);

        emit RestakedAfterLateExit(msg.sender, id, lockedBalance.amount, typeIndex);
    }
```

>[!NOTE]
The reason for this finding being a medium severity is that it breaks the core contract functionality of  the `owner` modifier in emergency cases,
Here is one similar  [finding](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-05-bypass-whennotpaused-modifier-code4rena-gogopool-gogopool-contest-git) to support my claim.
## Impact
In cases where the `owner` wants to stop all activity, they still can't stop users from retaking their `exited late` flagged lock.
