# The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function in the smart contract fails to properly implement pagination

## Summary

The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function within a smart contract designed to manage locked tokens exhibits a critical flaw in its pagination mechanism when retrieving locked balances. This report analyzes the misimplementation that leads to ineffective pagination, potentially causing performance degradation and incorrect processing of locked tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The core issue lies in the misuse of parameters when invoking the `getLocks()` function from within `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()`. Specifically, the function attempts to paginate through locked tokens but erroneously passes the total number of locks (`lockCount`) as the limit for each page. This results in the function attempting to retrieve all locks at once on each iteration, negating the benefits of pagination .

## Impact

The primary impacts of this vulnerability in the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function are manifold and affect both the performance and reliability of the smart contract:
 **Transaction Rollbacks Due to Deep Recursion**: The incorrect implementation may also lead to deep recursion if the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function is repeatedly called within a single transaction context due to its flawed pagination. This deep recursion could exceed the stack limits of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), leading to transaction rollbacks. Such rollbacks not only waste gas but also cause potential financial losses.

These issues combined pose a serious threat to the usability and operational integrity of the contract, potentially causing financial losses for users and damaging the reputation of the platform. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
    uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
    uint256 page;
    uint256 limit;
    uint256 totalUnlocked;
    
    while (limit < lockCount) {
        LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.  
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
            if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
            }
        }

        limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
        page++;
    }
    ...
}
```

```solidity
function getLocks(
    address user,
    uint256 page,
    uint256 limit
) public view override returns (LockedBalance[] memory) {
    LockedBalance[] memory locks = new LockedBalance[](limit);
    uint256 lockIdsLength = lockIndexesByUser[user].length();

    uint256 i = page * limit;
    for (;i < (page + 1) * limit && i < lockIdsLength; i ++) {
        locks[i - page * limit]= lockById[lockIndexesByUser[user].at(i)];
    }
    return locks;
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To rectify the identified issues, it is recommended to adjust the withdrawAllUnlockedToken() function to properly utilize the pagination mechanism provided by the getLocks() function. Specifically, the limit should be set to a constant representing the maximum number of locks to process per transaction, and the loop should incrementally fetch and process these locks without exceeding the total number of locks:
```solidity
function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
    uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
    uint256 page = 0;
    uint256 limit = 10;
    uint256 count = 0;
    uint256 totalUnlocked;
    
    while (count < lockCount) {
        LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, limit); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.  
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
            if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
            }
        }
        count += limit;
        page++;
    }
    ...
}
```
