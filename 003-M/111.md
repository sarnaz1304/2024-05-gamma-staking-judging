# Calculating reward in `exitLateById` is not right


## Summary
Calculating reward in `exitLateById` is not right
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);//@audit 解锁时间确定了

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
@>        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
@>        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
@>        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
@>        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }
```
When users call  `exitLateById`, they just want to exit in the end of this lockPeriod. But they will get no reward since `exitLateById` function  be called while their staking token still be staking in the Lock Contract.
One scenario is that the user, to minimize losses, will call exitLateById within a few seconds(e.g., 15 seconds) before the lockPeriod ends.
The transaction sent by the user may not be included in a block immediately and could remain in the transaction pool. Since an Ethereum block takes 15 seconds, it is entirely possible that the transaction may only be included in a block after, for example, 30 seconds.
This way, the user must wait for a another lockPeriod cycle (e.g., 30 days) to retrieve their staking tokens, and during this period, they will not receive any rewards.
## Impact
The user cannot withdraw their staking tokens normally and will be locked for an extended period(e.g., 30 days).That's some kind of DOS. Accord to Sherloc's rule(The issue causes locking of funds for users for more than a week.)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the staking tokens remain  in the lock contract, they are still  staking. Rewards stop being calculated only when the user withdraws their staking tokens.
