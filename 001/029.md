# Repeated Exit due to Missing Check in `setExitedLateToTrue` leading to locked funds

## Summary
`setExitedLateToTrue(...)` doesn't check if `lock` is already marked as `exitedLate`, which allows the same position to be exited multiple times.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `exitLateById` function, users are allowed to exit a specific position identified by `lockId`. This process involves marking the position as `exitedLate` using the `setExitedLateToTrue` function. However, the `setExitedLateToTrue `function does not check if the position is already marked as `exitedLate`. This oversight allows users to repeatedly exit the same position, leading to incorrect reductions in the total balances and can result in arithmetic underflow when attempting to exit other positions, effectively locking the user's funds in the contract.

**Example**
1. **Initial State:**
   - User has two positions:
     - Position 1: 1000 tokens, 1.5 multiplier
     - Position 2: 20000 tokens, 2 multiplier
   - Initial Balances:
     - `locked`: 21000 tokens
     - `lockedWithMultiplier`: 41500

2. **First Early Exit for Position 1:**
   - Removes 1000 tokens and reduces `lockedWithMultiplier` by 1500.
   - New Balances:
     - `locked`: 20000 tokens
     - `lockedWithMultiplier`: 40000

3. **Second Early Exit for the Same Position 1:**
   - Again removes 1000 tokens and reduces `lockedWithMultiplier` by 1500.
   - New Balances:
     - `locked`: 19000 tokens
     - `lockedWithMultiplier`: 38500

4. **Attempting to Exit Position 2:**
   - Position 2 tries to remove 20000 tokens.
   - Current Balances:
     - `locked`: 19000 tokens
     - `lockedWithMultiplier`: 38500

```solidity
  uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount *
            lockedBalance.multiplier; // 20000 * 2 = 40000
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance; 
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;  // 38500 - 40000 underflow!!
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the function checks if the `exitedLate` flag is already set to true before proceeding with the update.
```solidity
contract LockList.. {
  error AlreadyExitedLate();
  function setExitedLateToTrue(
            address user,
            uint256 lockId
        ) public override onlyOwner {
            if (!lockIndexesByUser[user].contains(lockId)) revert WrongLockId();
            if(lockById[lockId].exitedLate == true) revert AlreadyExitedLate();
            lockById[lockId].exitedLate = true;
        }
}

```
