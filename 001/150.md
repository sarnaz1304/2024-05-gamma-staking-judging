# users may end up paying more fees than they expected when trying to exit early

## Summary
users may end up paying more fees than they expected when trying to exit early

## Vulnerability Detail
if a user stakes for 30 seconds.  the penalty amount is calculated based on the unlock time as seen here,  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L596 

it is important to note that the new unlock time is calculated based on the modulus of time time staked, so the modulus of 30 seconds will be within the range of [0..29] max... according to this calculation https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L602 the closer `(block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod` is to 29  the smaller the lock period.  

Except that this calculatioin is  based on block.timestamp and users who initiate the transaction when this `(block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod` resulted in a solution closer to 29 may end up with a a longer time frame because block.timestamp can be manipulated and thus `(block.timestamp - lockTime) %  lockPeriod` can easily become 0, 1 or 2. leading to a longer period.

The longer the period calculated the  higher the penalty amount as shown here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L325

## Impact

Users can end up paying more fees when trying to exit early.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
users Trying to exit early lock period can be calculated as 

```solidity
(block.timestamp - lockTime)
```
