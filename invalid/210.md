# `exitLateById()`/`withdrawAllUnlockedToken()`/`withdrawUnlockedTokenById()` lack `whenNotPaused` check

## Summary

The functions `exitLateById()`, `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()`, `withdrawUnlockedTokenById()` are not using the `whenNotPaused` modifier. As a result, they remain operational during an emergency pause, which is unexpected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Lock.sol` protocol has a emergency pause feature. This feature is used for `_stake()` and `earlyExitById()` functions, which means user should not be able to stake or exit a stake. However, this is not applied for `exitLateById()`/`withdrawAllUnlockedToken()`/`withdrawUnlockedTokenById()`, this means users can exit a stake and withdraw tokens during pause.

```solidity
    function _stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex,
        bool isRelock
>   ) internal whenNotPaused {
        ...
    }

>   function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {    
        ...
    }

>   function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        ...
    }

>   function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        ...
    }

>   function withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id) external nonReentrant {
        ...
    }
```

## Impact

During an emergency pause, users can still exit locks by `exitLateById`, and withdraw tokens by `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` or `withdrawUnlockedTokenById`.
