# Pause functionality and access control not rightly implemented

## Summary
The pause function is not rightly implemented and there are no modifiers to take this into effect.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L669-L681

## Vulnerability Detail

Most of the core sensitive functionalities can still be carried out irrespective of `pause` or `unpause`. This is a break in logic because the protocol actually made provision for this but it just wasn't rightly implemented and would lead to unforeseeable casualties.

Pause functionalities and Unpause functionalities are very delicate controls that helps safeguard protocols and should be rightly implemented.

## Impact

- Protocol is vulnerable to attacks without a corresponding safe house logic

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause(); // Calls the internal _pause function which enforces the pause state across the contract.
    }

    function unpause() public onlyOwner {
        _unpause(); // Calls the internal _unpause function which deactivates the pause state across the contract.
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

restructure the logic.
