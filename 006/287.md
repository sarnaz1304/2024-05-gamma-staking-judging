# Removing a reward token is not possible

## Summary
Removing a reward token is not possible
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the contest README, it is possible to remove a reward. However, this functionality is not actually implemented and it is not possible for a reward to be removed from the `rewardTokens` array. This could cause issues as first of all, it is unexpected that the option to do that doesn't exist as the protocol specifically mentioned for that functionality and also, not being able to remove a token from the `rewardTokens` array could be dangerous in a lot of different cases, like a vulnerability, upgrade of the reward token, even a simple change of mind.
