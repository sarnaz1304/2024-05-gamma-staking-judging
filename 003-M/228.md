# Users may unintentionally lose their funds with `earlyExitById` or `exitLateById`

## Summary
Users may lose much higher funds when withdrawing their money in busy evm usage.
## Vulnerability Detail
If a user calls `earlyExitById` or `exitLateById` in a busy evm usage period OR with a low gas fee, it may be executed in "b time" instead of "a time". These functions are important because `unlockTime` is calculated in them. 
```text
______________a_|_b______________
^               ^
|               |
stake     lockPeriod_end
```

- If this happens with `earlyExitById` function, user will lose around %50 of his funds instead of %15. 
```solidity
    uint256 public basePenaltyPercentage; //  15% - Represents the fixed penalty amount for unlocking early
    uint256 public timePenaltyFraction; //  35% - Time-based penalty which decreases linearly with the passage of time
    uint256 public constant WHOLE = 100000; // 100%
```

```solidity
    function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

@>          penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
@>      penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }
```
- If this happens with `exitLateById` function, user have to wait second lockPeriod to withdraw it with `withdrawUnlockedTokenById` or he can withdraw it with penalty amount and it'll cause loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Consider to add buffer time like below:
```text
______________a_|(buffer time)|_b______________
^               ^             ^
|               |             |
stake     lockPeriod_end    restake_time
```
