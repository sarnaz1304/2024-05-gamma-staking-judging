# The user will lose all of his rewards.

## Summary
The user will lose all of his rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say the user stakes tokens for himself, and the amount he specifies is 50, these tokens are stored in the `Balances` struct. `bal.locked` for the user is updated to 50, and the `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` for the user is updated to `amount * multiplier`, for the sake of this explanation let's say that the multiplier is 2. The `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` for the user will be set to 100. After all of this happens `_updateRewardDebt` function is called for the user. This function calculates the reward debt in the next way:

```solidity
 rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
```
This takes all the cumulated rewards for the token that the user deposited and multiplies them for the amount that the user has locked with a multiplier in his balance. Let's say the value of the `cumulatedReward` of that token is 500, this will make the reward debt for the user with a value of 50000. Let's say that it is the 25th day after the user staked his token and he calls the `exitLateById` function and this function is represented as follows:
```solidity
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance; 
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance; 
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }
```
As we can see this function first calls the `_updateReward` function.
```solidity
function _updateReward(address account) internal {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Determine the number of reward tokens.
        Balances storage bal = balances[account]; // Access the balance record for the user.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[token]; // Get the reward data for the token.

            rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token); // Update the rewards for the user based on what has been earned so far.
            rewardDebt[account][token] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier; // Update the reward debt based on the latest reward information.

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

At the almost end of the `_updateReward` function the rewards for the user are set by calling the `_earned` function.
```solidity 
  function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```
If we assume that there wasn't much more staked of that token in that period the cumulatedReward was only updated to 520. The math will be this way.
`520 * 100 - 50000 = 2000`
So the earnings will have a value of 2000. 
After this the rewardDebt will be set to 52000.

After this, the `_updateRewardDebt` function is called.
```solidity
 function _updateRewardDebt(address _user) internal {
        Balances memory bal = balances[_user]; // Retrieve the current balance information for the user.

        for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; ++i) {
            address rewardToken = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each reward token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[rewardToken]; // Get the current reward data for each token.

            // Recalculate the reward debt for the user based on their locked balances and the accumulated rewards for the token.
            rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
        }
    }
```

The reward debt will stay the same with a value of 52000.
Not let's assume the 30 day period passed and the user calls the `getReward` function.

```solidity
 function getReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) public nonReentrant {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any accrued rewards up to the current point for the caller.
        _getReward(msg.sender, _rewardTokens); // Calls the internal _getReward function to process the actual reward claim.
    }
```
Which will call the `_updateReward` function again and that function. In the meantime let's assume that in those 5 days the `cumulatedReward` was updated to 540. This is where the problem lies because `_updateReward` will now calculate the rewards in the `_earned` function again but this time they will come out as 0 because `lockedWithMultiplier` balance for the user is now 0.
```solidity
function _updateReward(address account) internal {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Determine the number of reward tokens.
        Balances storage bal = balances[account]; // Access the balance record for the user.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[token]; // Get the reward data for the token.

            rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token); // Update the rewards for the user based on what has been earned so far.
            rewardDebt[account][token] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier; // Update the reward debt based on the latest reward information.

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
Now the cumulatedReward is 540 and the `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` is 0 because when the user called exitLateById the function reset the balance back to 0 and the funds he had were not stored anywhere except in the `_updateReward` function. So now when the `_earned` function happens the user won't have any rewards left to withdraw because the calculation will be done again but this time `bal.lockedWithMultiplier` will be 0.

Then the `getReward` function calls the `_getReward` function.
```solidity 
function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token. 
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
This function will then revert at the `if (reward > 0)` check and the user will not have any rewards left.

## Impact
The user will lose all of his rewards.

## Recommendation
When we call the `exitLateById` function store the funds in some kind of variable before removing them so the user is able to get his reward or don't calculate the reward with `_updateReward`  in `getReward` function again and use the calculation when `_updateReward` function was called in `exitLateById`.
