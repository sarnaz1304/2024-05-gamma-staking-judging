# It's impossible to `restakeAfterLateExit` if the protocol is paused.

## Summary
[Lock.restakeAfterLateExit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L378-L400) should allow users that have made a late exit restake again. There is an inconsistency between the pause requirements of exiting and restaking. As a result, it's possible to make a late exit when the protocol is paused, but a restake will not be allowed.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no `whenNotPaused` modifier applied to [exitLateById](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349C1-L371), which means users are allowed to do that in a paused state. 

```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
```

Any user who exits late should be able to perform a restake by calling `restakeAfterLateExit`. The internal `_stake` function will be called to execute the restake
```solidity
        // Proceed to restake the funds using the new lock type.
        _stake(lockedBalance.amount, msg.sender, typeIndex, true);
```
The problem is that [_stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L260-L307) has the `whenNotPaused` modifier, so the restake will not be allowed.
```solidity
    function _stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex,
        bool isRelock
    ) internal whenNotPaused
```
## Impact
In a paused state users are able to exit late, but restaking will fail, even though it should be an available feature after exiting late.

## Recommendation
Ensure that the requirement for the paused state is the same for the two functions.
