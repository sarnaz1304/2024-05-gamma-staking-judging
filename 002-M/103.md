# Calling `exitLateById` twice for the same lock will make the caller lose funds

## Summary

`exitLateById` has unexpected behaviour if called multiple times for the same lock. If a user has more than one locks, and calls `exitLateById` twice for the same lock, a part of their funds will become unwithdrawable.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user calls `exitLateById` for the same lock, two outcomes are possible:

a) if the caller doesn't have other locks or their locked value is less than the target lock's value, txn reverts due to panic in one of the two subtractions:
```solidity
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
```

b) txn succeeds because `lockedSupply` and `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` are big enough for the subtraction due to other locks.

Later, when trying to withdraw from other locks, it may not be possible, as the execution revert due to arithmetic underflow, as the subtractions were executed twice for the original lock, so `lockedSupply` and `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` will be lower than they should.

## Impact

Loss of funds for users who have other locks and called `exitLateById` more than once for the same lock, as they won't be able to claim at least one of their other locks.

```diff
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(
            msg.sender,
            id
        );
        
+       require(
+           !lockedBalance.exitedLate,
+           "This lock was already exited late"
+       );
        
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(
            msg.sender,
            id,
            block.timestamp + coolDownSecs
        );

        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount *
            lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender);
    }
