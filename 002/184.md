# Possible DOS in withdrawwlAllUnlockedToken function preventing user from withdrawing all his funds

## Summary
In `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` it loops through locks in pages basis each page containing 10 locks but the current implementation retrieve the full locks list in each iteration given a big enough array list will lead to an Out of gas error while withdrawing all tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
- consider having 30 stakes for a user
- the user want to withdraw all 30 stakes this will execute the while loop `while(limit < 30)` 
- first iteration for page = 0 will loop through all 30 locks as `locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount)` will get all the locks
- then for the next page (1) will get an empty lock list 
- same for page (2)
- if the array is big enough it will lead to the whole transaction reverting


## Impact
DOS of withdraw all tokenss
