# Users cannot get reward shares if they stake after reward addition

## Summary
If some users stake after the addition of rewards, they will not get any shares of the rewards in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The way calculating user accrued reward is coded in [`_earned`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L455):

```solidity
    function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```

Where `rewardDebt` is updated to the exact same value after this function is called in `_updateReward`. In `_stake`, after user balance is added and updated, `_updateRewardDebt` is called, and this function sets the `rewardDebt` to `rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier`:

```solidity
    function _updateRewardDebt(address _user) internal {
        Balances memory bal = balances[_user]; // Retrieve the current balance information for the user.

        for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; ++i) {
            address rewardToken = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each reward token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[rewardToken]; // Get the current reward data for each token.

            // Recalculate the reward debt for the user based on their locked balances and the accumulated rewards for the token.
            rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
        }
    }
```

This introduces an issue, and makes the values in `_earned` to be the same as `rewardDebt`. When users are trying to claim their rewards, `_updateReward` will be called, and since the update-to-date value of earned and debt are the same, this makes the returned value to be 0. And users won't get anything in the reward pool despite stake their assets. Until admin or some other parties added more rewards, they can get some new shares of the newly added rewards. And what's more, the previously staked users, who have staked before reward addition, will get extra shares of the newly shared assets, despite may potentially staked less than those newly staked users.

## Impact
Those users who stake later will get less reward, or, the users who have staked earlier will get more shares of the reward.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _updateRewardDebt(address _user) internal {
        Balances memory bal = balances[_user]; // Retrieve the current balance information for the user.

        for (uint i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; ++i) {
            address rewardToken = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each reward token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[rewardToken]; // Get the current reward data for each token.

            // Recalculate the reward debt for the user based on their locked balances and the accumulated rewards for the token.
            rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For each time rewards are added, make those who have staked earlier not eligible to claim the newly added pool.
