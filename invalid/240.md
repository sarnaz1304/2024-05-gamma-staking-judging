# `whenNotPaused` modifier not used consistently allows transfer of funds out of protocol even during emergency

## Summary
Then `whenNotPaused` modifier is not used consistently throughout the protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
Pausing is implemented in the protocol for emergency situations, [various](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L265) [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L313) [contain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L541) the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

The issue is that the modifier is not used consistently throughout the codebase. For example, it is used when a user is trying to exit early from a lock:

```solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
```

Meanwhile, exiting late from a lock (which is actually the proper way for exiting but naming convention used is weird), can be done even when paused:

```solidity
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external { // @audit missing whenNotPaused modifier
```

The logic of the early exit function contains transferring of funds, but the 2-step procedure to transfer out funds when exiting late is by later calling `withdrawUnlockedTokenById()`, which is also missing the modifier:

```solidity
function withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id) external nonReentrant { // @audit missing whenNotPaused modifier
```

I believe the mechanism of pausing in emergency situations was to limit the transfer of funds out of the protocol in such cases. But, due to the inconsistencies, this would allow a user to transfer out funds even during an emergency. If those funds are for example stolen in an illegal manner and funneled into the protocol, it would be quite problematic.

## Impact
Inconsistent modifier usage allows funds to be transferred out even during emergency pausing.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external { // @audit missing whenNotPaused modifier
```

```solidity
function withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id) external nonReentrant { // @audit missing whenNotPaused modifier
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to all functions that contain moving of funds since pausing is reserved only for emergency situations anyhow, this should not interfere with normal usage.
