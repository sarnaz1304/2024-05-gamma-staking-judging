# calcRemainUnlockPeriod is returning wrong remaining when the function is called at the end of lockperiod

## Summary

If `Lock.sol#calcRemainUnlockPeriod()`  function is called exactly at the end of the lock period Instead of returning zero seconds as remaining time defaultLockTime is being returned due to this the user needs to wait more time than intended time for withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        /**
        CASE 1: Function will return incorrect remaining time if passed time  ==  lockperiod
        lock Period = 360 days
        passed =  360 days
        default = 30 days
        Instead of returning 0 days this function is returning 360 days

        **/

        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
    
```


## Impact
User needs to wait more time for the withdrawal than intended time.
