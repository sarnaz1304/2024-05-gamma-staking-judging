# Anyone can hijack the `Lock` implementation contract after it is desployed

## Summary
The contract does not disable the initializers in the constructor, leaving the `initialize` function vulnerable to being called after the contract has been deployed. This allows anyone to hijack the implementation contract by initializing it  it with malicious parameters by calling `initialize`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [Lock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L18), the contract's constructor does not call the `disableInitializers` function provided by the OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts library. As a result, the `initialize` function, which serves as a substitute for the constructor in upgradeable contracts, can be called after the contract has been deployed.

## Impact
An attacker can call the `initialize` function after the contract has been deployed and set malicious parameters or addresses, effectively hijacking the contract's implementation.

## Code Snippet
N/A

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, the contract's constructor should call the `disableInitializers` function provided by the OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts library. This will prevent any further calls to the `initialize` function after the initial deployment and configuration of the contract.

The recommended code change would be to add the `disableInitializers` call in the contract's constructor or deployment script, like so:

```solidity
constructor() {
    // ... (other constructor code)

    // Disable further initialization
    disableInitializers();
}
```

By implementing this recommendation, you can ensure that the contract's initial configuration is set only during the initial deployment, and prevent unauthorized parties from hijacking the contract's implementation by initializing it with malicious parameters.
