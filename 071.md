# Early reward debt accumulation can lead to loss of rewards

## Summary

Early reward debt accumulation during staking can lead to loss of rewards if user stakes after rewards are notified.

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause lies in the immediate increment of rewardDebt when `stake()` is called.

Notice how `cumulateReward` is incremented via `_notifyReward()` when new rewards are notified, wherein this variable is never decremented.

Next, notice how within `stake()`, [`_updateRewardDebt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L278) is called immediately after staking, even if rewards are not claimed yet. This means subsequent stakes by stakers will automatically increment the current `cumulateReward * lockedBalanceMultiplier` on their rewardDebt. The `rewardDebt` would eventually be decremented within [`earned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L461) when computing rewards earned by user. This results in 2 impacts:


1. Users would have a zero reward token claim and lose all deserved rewards since rewards are zeroed out
2. Only staked positions before the first reward notification is called would earn rewards appropriately.

If user did not unlock position via `exitLatebyId`, he will lose rewards. And if user unlocks position via the intended flow of withdrawal through [`exitLateById()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L350) he also loses rewards due to the immediate increment of rewardDebt during staking.

Here's a simple POC, copy and run `forge test --mt testRewardZero` in `Withdraw.t.sol`

```solidity
function testRewardZero() public {
    // 1. First reward distribution, cumulateReward = 300e18
    vm.prank(deployer);
    _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300e18);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

    // 2. User 3 stakes 
    vm.prank(user3);
    lock.stake(100e18, user3, 2);
    uint256 rewardBalance = lock.rewards(address(user3), address(_rewardToken));
    console.log(rewardBalance);

    // 2.1 This part can me commented out and the user would still lose rewards
    LockedBalance[] memory user3Locks = lockList.getLocks(user3, 0, 10);
    LockedBalance memory user3Lock = lockList.getLockById(user3, user3Locks[0].lockId);
    vm.prank(user3);
    lock.exitLateById(user3Lock.lockId);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30); // Simulate time passage

    // 3. User 3 retrieve 0 rewards
    vm.prank(user3);
    lock.getAllRewards();
    assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 0);
    assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(address(lock)), 300e18);
}
```

## Impact

1. Users would have a zero reward token claim and lose all deserved rewards since rewards are zeroed out
2. Only staked positions before the first reward notification is called would earn rewards appropriately.

## Recommendation

Only update reward debt after rewards are claimed within `getReward`
