# MEV Bots Can Exploit Paused State in _stake Function

## Summary
To create a fairer environment and mitigate the risk of MEV bots exploiting the paused state of the contract, consider removing the whenNotPaused modifier from the _stake function. This change ensures that staking operations can continue even when the contract is paused, preventing MEV bots from gaining an unfair advantage over the users.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Current State:
The _stake function is designed to handle the staking of tokens, applying specified lock types and managing reward eligibility.
It is currently protected by the whenNotPaused modifier, which prevents staking operations when the contract is paused.

2. Vulnerability:
MEV bots can monitor the blockchain for transactions and manipulate the order of transactions to their advantage.
When the contract is paused, regular users cannot stake tokens, but MEV bots can exploit this by front-running or back-running transactions to stake tokens as soon as the contract is unpaused.

## Impact
Unfair Advantage: MEV bots can stake tokens at optimal times, gaining more rewards compared to regular users.

## Recommendation

Remove the whenNotPaused modifier from the _stake function to allow staking operations to continue even when the contract is paused.
This ensures that all users have equal opportunities to stake their tokens, creating a fairer environment.
