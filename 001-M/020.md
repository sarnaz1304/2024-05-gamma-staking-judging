## Inefficient Handling of Large Lock Count Leads to Out-of-Gas Errors in `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` Function

## Summary
The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function has a potential vulnerability related to inefficient handling of a large number of locks. This can lead to out-of-gas errors, preventing users from withdrawing their unlocked tokens if they have many locks.

## Vulnerability Detail
`withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function attempts to process all locks for a user in a single iteration withoud proper pagination. This can result in excessive gas consumption, especially for usets with a large number of locks. When the gas limit is exceeded, the transaction fails, preventing users from withdrawing their unlocked tokens. This makes the function unusable for users with many locks effectively locking their funds.

## Impact
Users with a large number of locks are unable to withdraw their unlocked tokens due to out-of-gas errors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The changes initialize pagination variables and process locks in batches, ensuring efficient handling of large numbers of locks and preventing gas limit issues during token withdrawal.

```diff
 function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); 
-      uint256 page;
+      uint256 page = 0;
-      uint256 limit;
+      uint256 limit = 10;
        uint256 totalUnlocked;
        
-       while (limit < lockCount) {
+       while (page * limit < lockCount) {
-           LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount);
+           LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, limit);
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount;
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId);
                }
            }

-           limit += 10;
            page++;
        }

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked);
        emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked);
    }
```
