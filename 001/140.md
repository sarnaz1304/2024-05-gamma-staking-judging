# `calcRemainUnlockPeriod()` gives incoorect remain time for a lock

## Summary
`calcRemainUnlockPeriod()`  determines the remaining time until a user's locked balance can be unlocked.  This remain time is used in calculalation of penalty amount and wrong penalty will be transferred to treasury due to incorrect remain time

## Vulnerability Detail
```soldity
    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) { 
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;//@audit-issue HIGH will give incorrect results if lockPeriod and defaultRelocktime are not integral multiples
        }
    }

```
From the design of protocol , after completion of lock period staked amount will be locked automatically for min(locktime, relocktime). The issue is that if `lockPeriod % defaultRelockTime !=0 `. There is flaw in logic which works only for the cases `lockPeriod % defaultRelockTime == 0`. 

1. Suppose LockPeriod for lock is 50 days and defaultRelockTime is same as 30 days such that 50%30 is not zero
2. User 1 stake some tokens and at 55th day he wanna calculate Remain unlock period for his lock.
3. Remain time should be 25 days as he already passed 5 days of DefaultRelocktime

Do these needful changes in `UnlockCalculation.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt testUserIncorrectUnlockPeriodResult`

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        lock = new Lock();
        lockList = new LockList(deployer);

        rewardTokens.push(address(_rewardToken));

        lock.setStakingToken(address(_stakingToken));
        lock.addReward(address(_rewardToken));

        _stakingToken.mint(user5, 1000e18);
        _rewardToken.mint(deployer, 10000e18);
        lock.setTreasury(address(0x4));
        lockList.transferOwnership(address(lock));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.prank(user1);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(lock), 10000e18);
        vm.prank(user2);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(lock), 10000e18);

        vm.prank(user5);
        _stakingToken.approve(address(lock), 10000e18);
    }

    function testUserIncorrectUnlockPeriodResult() public {
      vm.prank(user1);
      lock.stake(100e18, user1, 1); // User A stakes with the second lock type which is 50 days

      /** unlock period will give incorrect result if locktime % Relocktime != 0 
          Lets keep the locktime for our stake 40 days and Relocktime is 30 days
       */

      vm.warp(block.timestamp + 55 days); // Simulate passing 65 days
      LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user1, 0);
      uint256 remainPeriod = lock.calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
      assertEq(remainPeriod, 25 days, "Remaining unlock period should be 25 days for User A."); 
      //Remain time should be 25 days since 5 days already passed in the relock time period so remain time after 55 days will be 50 + 30 - 55 = 25 days
  }


```
Above test fails which shows remain time calculation is wrong. The correct remain time should be 25 days while this comes out to be 5 days


## Impact
Incorrect Remain unlock period and hence incorrect penalty amount transfer

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle the case when lockPeriod % DefaultLocktime !=0.  A good approach could be take the modulo of (overallTime from starting - lockperiod) over DefaultLocktime  instead of `(block.timestamp - lockTime)`, since after completion of lockperiod all the relock period will integral multiple of DefaultLocktime
