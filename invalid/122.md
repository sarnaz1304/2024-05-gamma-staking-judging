# Linear decrease of the penalty is not properly implemented

## Summary
Linear decrease of the penalty is not properly implemented
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon exiting out of the staking early, users are obliged to pay a penalty based on how early they have exited. Users can choose their lockup period as well as multiplier, a longer lockup period results in a bigger multiplier that is used to compute their rewards. The way the penalty is calculated however, leaves a possible way for users to game the system.

This is how the penalty gets computed:
```solidity
...
penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
...
penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
```
`unlockTime - block.timestamp` can be at most equal to `lockPeriod`. Thus, the maximum value for the `penaltyFactor` would be equal to the `timePenaltyFraction` which is 35% according to the inline docs. That means that if there was an option for a user to stake for let's say, a 100 years and thus, get a very large multiplier, he would still receive at most `35% + basePenaltyPercentage` as a fee even if he exited the protocol immediately. This allows users to use large lockup periods and multipliers to their advantage by exiting the system immediately after for example, staking before adding of rewards, claiming the rewards and withdrawing right after while still being in profit thanks to the large multiplier and still paying the same fee as someone who decided to lockup his funds for let's say, just 5 minutes with a small multiplier.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not calculate the penalty as a ratio of the lockup period but based on the amount of time they are early by when exiting.
