# The reward tokens and the staking tokens are not compatible with rebase/fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
If FoT or rebasing tokens are selected as rewards or staking tokens, it may cause problems with the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
ERC20 tokens are used for reward/stakings, and if any of those are FoT tokens, it will affect the distribution/withdrawal as the amount recorded have not taken FoT tokens into [considerations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L272).

## Impact
FoT tokens are not compatible, and may lead to calculations being done wrong.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex,
        bool isRelock
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        if (typeIndex >= lockPeriod.length || amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();

        _updateReward(onBehalfOf);
        
        Balances storage bal = balances[onBehalfOf];

        bal.locked += amount;
        lockedSupply += amount;
        // ... snip
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If FoT tokens are not supported, add a check if those are added as reward/staking tokens.
