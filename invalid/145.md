# User can withdraw their staked tokens even when the protocol is in a paused state due to an emergency.


## Summary
The functions exitLateById, withdrawAllUnlockedToken, and withdrawUnlockedTokenById lack the whenNotPaused check, which allows a user to withdraw their staked tokens even when the protocol is paused due to an emergency.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user shouldn't be able to withdraw their staked tokens when the protocol is paused. However, due to the absence of the whenNotPaused modifier, a user can withdraw all their staked tokens.

## Impact
Withdrawing staked tokens when the protocol is paused.
