# Users can profit from the protocol over and over again

## Summary
Users can profit from the protocol over and over again
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can stake tokens in order to receive rewards. If they decide they want to exit out of the system, it is possible for them to do so but they will owe a penalty to the protocol. However, it is possible for users to still profit from that and disrupt the functionality of the protocol.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. Reward token (WETH) has a price of $3000 and the staking token (GAMMA) has a price of $0.10
2. Protocol was just deployed and there are no stakes nor rewards
3. There is a deposit of rewards for the WETH token (deposit amount is 1 WETH = $3000) and user anticipates/frontruns it by staking
4. He stakes any amount of GAMMA that has a $ value lower than 3000 + 3000 / 2= 4500. (< 4500). Let's say he stakes $4000 of GAMMA.
5. He immediately exits out of the system and now owes 50% to the protocol as penalty (35% for the linear decreasing percentage, 15% as the flat percentage). He gets $2000 back and loses $2000 as penalty.
6. He immediately withdraws the rewards which are equal to the whole deposit amount as he is the only staker, thus getting $3000.

He lost $2000 but gained $3000 for basically no risk and this attack can be repeated as many times as an user might like, effectively gaming the protocol as well as disrupting the usage of it.

Note that this attack is also possible if there are also other stakers in the system, however the formula for the amount he has to deposit would be different. While the protocol mentioned that frontrunning would not be an issue due to the lockup period, it is clear that the lockup period will not be enough of a protection against that.
## Impact

## Recommendation
Increasing the penalty would be an option.
