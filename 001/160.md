# `Lock.sol#earlyExitById()` - In case of emergencies, when the protocol is paused, users can't early withdraw

## Summary
`Lock` implements pausing functionality by inheriting `PausableUpgradeable`.

Protocols pause their contracts in case of some sort of emergency.

The issue here is that if the protocol is paused, users are always forced to wait for their `unlockTime`, as they can only call `exitLateById` and then call `withdrawUnlockedTokenById`, as `earlyExitById` has the `whenNotPaused` modifier.
## Vulnerability Detail
In case of emergency, users would want to just withdraw their funds and pay the `penaltyAmount` if applicable, instead of waiting for their `unlockTime` to pass so they can withdraw their funds.
## Impact
Temp DoS of system operation
