# `Lock.sol` does not have a function to remove rewardTokens.

## Summary

`Lock.sol` does not have a function to remove rewardTokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Lock.sol` main protocol only has a function to add rewardTokens, but doesn't have a function to remove it.

```solidity
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```

The contest readme states the following, so it is assumed that the protocol should support a removing rewardToken feature:

> Additionally, re-adding a removed reward token would corrupt the reward data. The assumption should be that once a reward token is removed, it would not be re-added in the future.

and

> Q: Please list any known issues/acceptable risks that should not result in a valid finding.
> 
> Re-adding a removed token will corrupt the reward data.

## Impact

Admins would not be able to deprecate an existing rewardToken.
