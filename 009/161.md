# Delayed Withdrawal of Unlocked Tokens in `Lock.sol`

## Summary

The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function in the `Lock.sol` contract allows users to withdraw all their unlocked tokens. However, there is a logical issue in the condition that checks whether tokens can be withdrawn, causing users to wait beyond the unlock time to withdraw their tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the following `if` statement within the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function:

```solidity
if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp)
```

This condition allows users to withdraw their tokens only if the unlock time is strictly less than the current timestamp. This means users cannot withdraw their tokens immediately when the unlock time is reached; they must wait until the timestamp is strictly greater than the unlock time. The condition should include an equal sign (`<=`) to allow withdrawals as soon as the unlock time is reached.

## Impact

Users experience a delay in withdrawing their unlocked tokens. This minor inconvenience can lead to user frustration and loss of confidence in the system, particularly if they need access to their tokens immediately upon unlocking.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:
[Line 418](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L418)

```solidity
function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
  uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
  uint256 page;
  uint256 limit;
  uint256 totalUnlocked;

  while (limit < lockCount) {
    LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(
      msg.sender,
      page,
      lockCount
    ); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
      if (
        lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 &&
        lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp
      ) {
        // @audit should be <= block.timestamp cause i should be able to withdraw when its time
        totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
      }
    }

    limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
    page++;
  }

  IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
  emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the condition to allow users to withdraw their tokens as soon as the unlock time is reached by using `<=` instead of `<`:

```solidity
if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime <= block.timestamp) {
    ...
}
```

This change ensures that users can withdraw their tokens immediately when the unlock time is reached, providing a better user experience.
