# Lack of Input Validation Leads to Unpredictable Behavior

medium 
Input Validation
## Summary
The contract lacks thorough input validation in critical functions, such as earlyExitById and exitLateById. These functions assume the correctness of inputs related to lock IDs and states without explicitly verifying these conditions against the contract's state. This assumption can lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect execution paths if the inputs do not match the expected state or if they are manipulated by an attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where an attacker identifies that the contract does not validate the lockId parameter in the earlyExitById function. They decide to exploit this by submitting a request to exit a lock that doesn't actually exist or is not associated with their account. In a real-world scenario, this could lead to the contract attempting to process a non-existent lock, potentially resulting in lost funds or other unintended consequences.

PoC Steps
Identify a Non-Existent Lock ID: The attacker identifies a lockId that does not correspond to any existing lock in the contract's state.
Submit Request to earlyExitById: The attacker sends a transaction to the earlyExitById function with the identified non-existent lockId.
Observe Contract Behavior: Depending on the contract's implementation, this could lead to various outcomes, ranging from failing silently (if the contract checks for the lock's existence but does not revert) to reverting with an error message (if the contract correctly identifies the non-existent lock and reverts the transaction).


## Impact
Security: Malicious actors could manipulate inputs to trigger unintended behaviors, potentially leading to unauthorized access to funds or benefits within the contract.
Functionality: Incorrect input validation could cause functions to behave unpredictably, leading to failed transactions or incorrect state transitions.
User Trust: Users might lose trust in the contract's reliability and security, impacting adoption and usage.

## Recommendation
Implement Explicit Checks: Before proceeding with operations that affect locks, explicitly verify the existence and eligibility of locks. This can include checking if the lock exists, if it's eligible for the operation (e.g., not expired or already processed), and if the operation aligns with the lock's intended purpose.

Example:

`require(lockExistsAndIsEligible(lockId), "Invalid lock ID or operation not allowed.");
`

Use Safe Libraries : Consider using safe math libraries (like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath) to ensure arithmetic operations do not lead to integer overflow or underflow issues, indirectly contributing to more predictable behavior.
Thorough Testing : Enhance unit tests to cover edge cases and invalid inputs. Automated testing tools can help catch issues early in the development cycle.
