# stakingToken cannot be updated

## Summary
The function `Lock::setStakingToken` is used to sets the token address that will be used for staking purposes.
But becomes impossible to set subsequent staking tokens due to a check.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L152-L157

## Vulnerability Detail
The function has a check ` if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();` that reverts if the _stakingToken = 0 or stakingToken is not equal to 0.

The check is correctly implemented to safe guard against the first instantiation of the stakingToken. And after the first instantiation of the function, the stakingToken address is no longer 0. Hence, subsequent calls to the function will revert.

## Impact

- stakingToken can no longer be updated


## Code Snippet

```solidity
    
     function setStakingToken(address _stakingToken) external onlyOwner {
        // @audit - stakingToken cannot be updated
        if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero(); //‚ùå
        stakingToken = _stakingToken;

        emit SetStakingToken(_stakingToken);
    }
  
```
