# Incomplete token withdrawal due to incorrect looping logic in `Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken`

## Summary
The [`withdrawAllUnlockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L409-L430) function contains a logic flaw in its pagination mechanism, potentially leading to incomplete withdrawal of unlocked tokens. Specifically, the use of `limit += 10` and `page++` does not correctly paginate through a user's locks, causing some unlocked tokens to be missed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The pagination logic in  [`withdrawAllUnlockedToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L409-L430) is incorrect. The function is supposed to iterate through all user locks and withdraw the unlocked ones. However, the use of `limit += 10` and `page++` results in an incorrect loop condition, this could result in some unlocked tokens not being withdrawn if the number of locks is not a multiple of 10.

### Proof Of Concept:
Consider a user with 15 locked balances, out of which 12 are unlocked:
1. The function calls `locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, 0, 15)`, retrieving the first 10 locks.
2. It processes these locks, unlocking all 10.
3. `limit` is incremented by 10, and `page` is incremented by 1.
4. On the next iteration, `locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, 1, 15)` is called, but this retrieves the same 15 locks again.
5. As a result, the remaining 2 unlocked tokens are not processed or withdrawn.

## Impact
This logic flaw can result in users not being able to withdraw all their unlocked tokens, loss of funds.

```solidity
    function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
        uint256 page;
        uint256 limit;
        uint256 totalUnlocked;
        
        while (limit < lockCount) {
            LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }


            limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
            page++;
        }


        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
        emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, update the pagination logic to correctly iterate through all user locks without missing any. Here is the recommended code change:



```diff
function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
    uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
-    uint256 page;
-    uint256 limit;
+    uint256 page = 0;
    uint256 totalUnlocked;

-    while (limit < lockCount) {
-        LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
+    while (page * 10 < lockCount) {
+        LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, 10); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
            if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
            }
        }

-        limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
        page++;
    }

    IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
    emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
}
```
