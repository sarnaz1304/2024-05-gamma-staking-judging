# Even after passing of defaultRelockTime and LockPeriod ,users have to wait to  withdraw his assets

## Summary
- Even after passing of defaultRelockTime and LockPeriod, users have to wait to  withdraw his assets

## Vulnerability Detail
- Let's understand through an example.
- Alice stakes 1e18 assets for 30 days and defaultRelockTime is 30 days.
- After passage of 70 days he exits using exitLateById() .
- Inside exitLateById() `calcRemainUnlockPeriod()` is called where this function would return 30 days - (70 days) % 30 days = 20 days
- Even though LockPeriod and  defaultRelockTime has been passed but `calcRemainUnlockPeriod` returns 20 days which means we can withdraw our assets after another 20 days.
## Impact
- Users can't withdraw their unlocked amount even though lockPeriod and defaultRelockTime has been passed.
