# There is no way to remove rewards tokens

## Summary
[Lock.addReward()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L172-L182) is used to add rewards tokens to the staking contract. This action pushes new item in the `rewardTokens` array. Once pushed there, there is no way to remove the token. This cannot be the intended design - according to the readme reward tokens should be removable 

> Additionally, re-adding a removed reward token would corrupt the reward data.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the newest Sherlock rules,

> The protocol team can use the README (and only the README) to define language that indicates the codebase's restrictions and/or expected functionality. Issues that break these statements, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.

Removing reward tokens is clearly an expected functionality not currently present in the codebase.

## Impact
Lack of important contract feature. This can lead to DOS of the whole staking contract if a vulnerability is discovered in one of the reward tokens, since there is no way to remove it.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function for removing reward tokens
