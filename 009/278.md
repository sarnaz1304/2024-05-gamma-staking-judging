# Paritally incorrect condition check in `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` prevents withdrawal at exact time of `unlockTime`

## Summary
The if condition stated in the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` checks that `unlockedTime` should not be 0 and `unlockedTime` for a lock should be < current time. As per the logic, unlockedTime is the time at which the user's token are unlocked and eligible for withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the logic, unlockedTime is the time at which the user's token are unlocked and eligible for withdrawal. Thus at instance when unlockTime = block.timestamp, the user should be allowed to add the `lockedBals[i].amount`  into the `totalUnlocked` that they are expecting to withdraw.

## Impact
When the value of unlockTime = block.timestamp, the user still won't be allowed to add the `lockedBals[i].amount`  into the `totalUnlocked` value that they are expecting to withdraw.

        if (lockedBal.unlockTime != 0 && lockedBal.unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lockedBal.amount); // Transfers the unlocked amount to the user.
            locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, id); // Removes the lock from the lock list.
            emit WithdrawUnlockedById(id, msg.sender, lockedBal.amount); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal of the unlocked tokens.
