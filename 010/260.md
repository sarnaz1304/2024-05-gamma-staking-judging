# Incorrect Reward Calculation Due to Missing `_updateReward` Call in claimableRewards function

## Summary

The claimableRewards function may calculate incorrect rewards because it doesn't call _updateReward to update rewardDebt. Adding _updateReward ensures accurate reward calculations.


## Vulnerability Detail

The claimableRewards function calculates the claimable rewards for a user by calling the `_earned()` function. However, `_earned()` relies on the `rewardDebt` mapping, which may not be up-to-date. The `rewardDebt` mapping is updated in the `_updateReward` function, but `_updateReward` is not called within `claimableRewards`. This can lead to incorrect reward calculations.

below is the `claimableRewards()` function
```solidity

 function claimableRewards(
        address account
    )
        external
        view
        override
        returns (RewardData[] memory rewardsData)
    {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length;
        rewardsData = new RewardData[](length);
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
            rewardsData[i].token = rewardTokens[i];

            rewardsData[i].amount = (_earned(
                account,
                rewardsData[i].token
            ) + rewards[account][rewardTokens[i]]) / 1e36;
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
        return rewardsData;
    }

```
and below is the _earned function

```solidity

 function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```
as we can see earnings is calculated by subtracting `rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken];` but in the `claimableRewards()` the _updateRewards function is not called which may endup feeding old value rather than the latest `rewardDebt` value

## Impact

Users may receive incorrect reward amounts, either overestimating or underestimating their claimable rewards

## Recommendation

Call _updateReward before calculating the claimable rewards to ensure that the rewardDebt mapping is up-to-date.
