# Staking rewards incorrectly calculated

## Summary

Staking rewards for users are incorrectly calculated if there are 'unseen' reward tokens when `Lock.stake(...)` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation for staking reward depends on the `Lock` contract's storage variable `rewardData[rewardToken].cumulatedReward` which has to be updated manually via `notifyUnseenReward(...)` call for each reward token.

This leads to an issue when the `rewardData[rewardToken].cumulatedReward` wasn't updated after the most recent reward token amount was sent to the `Lock` contract's address, leading to that user receiving higher reward amounts than they were supposed to, due to the `_updateRewardDebt(user)` being called with lower value for `rewardData[rewardToken].cumulatedReward`. 

If this happens, the function `getReward(...)` calculates higher earnings for that user, which eats away at the earnings of others.


Example:
- `S` - staking token amount
- `RTOK` - reward token

1. `User1` locks `S` staking tokens with a 2x multiplier
```solidity
balances[User1].lockedWithMultiplier = 2 * S
lockedSupplyWithMultiplier = 2 * S
rewardDebt[User1][RTOK] = 0
```
2. Multiple rewards are sent to the `Lock` contract's address (in total: 100)

```solidity
RTOK.balanceOf(address(Lock)) = 100
```
3. `Lock.notifyUnseenReward(...)` has been triggered  

```solidity
rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward = 100
```

4. Multiple rewards are sent to the `Lock` contract's address (in total: 100)
```solidity
RTOK.balanceOf(address(Lock)) = 200
```

5. **------------> `Lock.notifyUnseenReward(...)` has not been triggered !!!** 
```solidity
rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward = 100 // !!! not updated
```

6. `User2` locks `S` staking tokens with a 2x multiplier
```solidity
balances[User2].lockedWithMultiplier = 2 * S
lockedSupplyWithMultiplier += 2 * S = 4 * S
rewardDebt[User2][RTOK] = rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward * 2 * S = 200 * S
```

7. Multiple rewards are sent to the `Lock` contract's address (in total: 100)
```solidity
RTOK.balanceOf(address(Lock)) = 300
```

8. `Lock.notifyUnseenReward(...)` has been triggered  
```solidity
rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward = 300
```

9. `getRewards(...)` called by `User1/2`
```solidity
// `_earned()` is called by `_updateReward(...)` inside `_getRewards()`

Lock._earned(User1, RTOK) returns: 
  rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward * 2 * S - rewardDebt[User1][RTOK]
    = 300 * 2 * S - 0 = 600 * S
Lock._earned(User2, RTOK) returns: 
  rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward * 2 * S - rewardDebt[User2][RTOK]
    = 300 * 2 * S - 200 * S = 400 * S
```

**!!! Making the actual ratio:  User1 (66.67%) and User2 (33.33%) but the correct ratio should be: User1 (83.33%) and User2 (16.66%) of rewards (total: 300). !!!**

## Impact

Loss of user funds

## Code Snippet

The Reward debt storage var. for the user wasn't set correctly, leading to incorrect substraction during earning calculation.

Affected functions:

`Lock._updateRewardDebt()` called inside `Lock._stake()`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L644

`Lock._earned(...)` called inside `Lock._updateReward(...)` - triggered by `Lock.getReward()`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L461

POC:  https://gist.github.com/vaniiiii/cc33fd27ee7353c4efd9f630526ffb2e#file-issues-sol-L65

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `rewardData[RTOK].cumulatedReward` storage variable before `_stake() internal` call inside the `stake()` function.

```solidity
contract Lock {

    function stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex
    ) external override {
        notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
    }
}
```
