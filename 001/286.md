# Users can lose part of their rewards if they withdraw before calling `_notifyUnseenReward`

## Summary

Users risk losing part of their rewards if they withdraw rewards before calling `_notifyUnseenReward` from `function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external`

## Vulnerability Detail

when a user stakes an amount of  tokens, they transfer them to the `Lock.sol contract` which increases the token balance of the contract. the `function notifyUnseenReward` is used to Check and update unseen rewards for a list of reward tokens. if this function is not called before a user redraws their rewards they will end up losing a part or all of their accrued rewards.

## Impact

there is a potential loss of rewards for users
