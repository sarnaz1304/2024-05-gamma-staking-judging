# User might accidentally lock for undesirable amount of time if `setLockTypeInfo` is called at the same time

## Summary
User might be forced to lock their funds for longer than anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail
When staking into the contract, the way users choose the longevity of their stake is by inputting `typeIndex`. Based on the index they've inputted, the lock duration is fetched from the `lockPeriod` array.

The problem is that while the user submits their transaction, admins could call `setLockTypeInfo` and change the values of the `lockPeriod` array. The same index which corresponded to `30 days` can now correspond to `360 days` and would force the user in such long lock.

```solidity
    function setLockTypeInfo(
        uint256[] calldata _lockPeriod,
        uint256[] calldata _rewardMultipliers
    ) external onlyOwner {
        if (_lockPeriod.length != _rewardMultipliers.length)
            revert InvalidLockPeriod();
        delete lockPeriod;
        delete rewardMultipliers;
        uint256 length = _lockPeriod.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
            lockPeriod.push(_lockPeriod[i]);
            rewardMultipliers.push(_rewardMultipliers[i]);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }

        emit SetLockTypeInfo(lockPeriod, rewardMultipliers);
    }
```
