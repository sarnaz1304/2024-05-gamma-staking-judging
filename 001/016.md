# Calling `earlyExitById` near the period end might accidentally lead to losing the entire locked amount.

## Summary
If `earlyExit` is called near the end of the period, user may lose their money

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can call `earlyExit` to unlock their position earlier than supposed to, and pay fee based on the remaining lock time.

The problem is that if the function is called near the end of the period and transaction is pending for some time, it may cause it to execute in the beginning of next period, which will make the penalty fee significantly higher and likely lose all of the user's locked amount.

```solidity
    function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }
        else {
            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
    }
```

Imagine the following scenario: 

1. 3 minutes remain until a user's lock period ends
2. User calls `earlyExitById`, expecting to only pay a negligible fee
3. User's transaction remains pending for 5 minutes
4. User's transaction executes in the beginning of next period and forces user to take a significant loss
