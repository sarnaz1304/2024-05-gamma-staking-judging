# Uninitialized `Lock::treasury` Address and Missing Zero Address Check during `Lock::setTreasury` Can Result in Early Exit Penalties Being Burned

## Summary

During `Lock::initialize`, `Lock::treasury` is not set and is instead initialized to the zero address during deployment. If `Lock::setTreasury` is not called after deployment with the treasury address or the zero address is passed, all early exit penalties intended for the protocol treasury will be burned instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

During deployment, all storage variable addresses are initialized to zero and are then set when calling `Lock::initialize`, except for `Lock::treasury`. The treasury address is set in a later, separate call to `Lock::setTreasury`. This function is inconsistent with all other owner-gated functions that set address-related variables (`setStakingToken`, `addReward`), in that it lacks a zero address check.

## Impact

If the deployer forgets to call `Lock::setTreasury` after deployment, or accidentally passes the zero address, all subsequent `Lock::earlyExitById` calls will result in penalties being burned instead of sent to the protocol's treasury. This is unintended behavior.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _locklist,
        uint128 _basePenaltyPercentage,
        uint128 _timePenaltyFraction,
        address _owner
    ) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
        if (_locklist == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (_basePenaltyPercentage > WHOLE || _timePenaltyFraction > WHOLE)
            revert WrongScaledPenaltyAmount();

        locklist = ILockList(_locklist);
        basePenaltyPercentage = _basePenaltyPercentage;
        timePenaltyFraction = _timePenaltyFraction;
        defaultRelockTime = 30 days;
        // @audit treasury is not set during initialize
    }
```

```solidity
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
        // @audit no zero address check
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set `treasury` during `initialize`. Check for the zero address during when setting `treasury` in `initialize` and `setTreasury`.

```diff
    function initialize(
        address _locklist,
        uint128 _basePenaltyPercentage,
        uint128 _timePenaltyFraction,
        address _owner
+       address _treasury
    ) public initializer {
        __Ownable_init(_owner);
+       if (_treasury == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (_locklist == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        if (_basePenaltyPercentage > WHOLE || _timePenaltyFraction > WHOLE)
            revert WrongScaledPenaltyAmount();

        locklist = ILockList(_locklist);
        basePenaltyPercentage = _basePenaltyPercentage;
        timePenaltyFraction = _timePenaltyFraction;
        defaultRelockTime = 30 days;
+       treasury = _treasury;
    }
```

```diff
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
+       if (_treasury == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
    }
