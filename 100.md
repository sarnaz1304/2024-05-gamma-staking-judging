# Incorrect reward logic can lead to stealing of funds

## Summary
When 3 users stake in 3 different locks and one of them deposits significantly less (for eg 1token) he gets rewarded way higher than supposed to. for staking 1 token you should be rewarded a small amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The incorrect rewards logic  when staking gives a realtively low staker too much profit(rewards).

### PoC
1. Using the same `Deposit.t.sol`
2. Search for  [`testSimpleDeposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/test/Deposit.t.sol#L13)
3. run the tests normally and observe the rewards of 100e18 stake
4. Change the stake amount of user2 from 100e18 to 1
5. Observe the increase in rewards significantly, after running the test.

Modified `Deposit.t.sol` 

```solidity
function testSimpleDeposit() public {
        // Simulating deposits by three different users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);
        vm.prank(user2);
        // changed amount
        lock.stake(1, user2, 1);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.stake(100e18, user3, 2);
        
        ...
        }
```


## Impact
malicious user can drain  funds

## Code Snippet
[`stake()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L245)

[`_stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L260) - staking logic

```solidity
    function stake(
        uint256 amount,
        address onBehalfOf,
        uint256 typeIndex
    ) external override {
        _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Min amount to stake & max amount to stake must be implemented.
Reward logic should be reviewed.
