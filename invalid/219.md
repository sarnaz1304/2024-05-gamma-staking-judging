# `recoverERC20` and `_getReward` current implementation allows some user's funds to be locked in the contract for forever.

## Summary
The current implementation of `recoverERC20` & `_getReward` allows some user's funds to be locked in the contract forever
## Vulnerability Detail
>[!NOTE]
USDC/USDT can blacklist any user.

```solidity
    /// @notice Transfers accrued rewards for specified tokens to the user.
    /// @dev Iterates through the list of reward tokens and transfers each accrued reward to the user's address, provided the reward amount is greater than zero.
    ///      This function also updates the reward balances and logs the reward payments.
    /// @param _user The address of the user receiving the rewards.
    /// @param _rewardTokens An array of reward token addresses from which the user is claiming rewards.
    //audit: rewards arent claimable if the user is blocklisted of a particular token
    function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
As you see in `_getReward` if any user gets blacklisted by USDC/USDT, it would lead to transactions reverting.
The bigger issue is in the array of `RewardTokens`. Here is a scenario for better understanding.
Assume there are 4 reward tokens whitelisted by the `ADMIN` (X, Y, USDC, USDT).Â 
Now, depending on how the tokens are set in the array, the amount of reward will vary.
>**Case:** [usdc, x, y, usdt]
>In this case, the loop won't be going to even the second RewardToken(x) making him lose all of his rewards



>[!IMPORTANT]
Now normally in the above case `recoverERC20` should be helpful, but the current implementation only allows recovery of non-active RewardToken which in the above case wont be true coz user can able to claim them in the first place

```solidity

    /// @notice Allows the contract owner to recover ERC-20 tokens sent to the contract under specific conditions.
    /// @dev This function can only be executed by the contract owner and is meant for recovering tokens that are not actively being used as rewards or are not the staking token itself.
    ///      It checks if the token is currently active as a reward or if it's the staking token to prevent accidental or unauthorized recovery.
    /// @param tokenAddress The address of the ERC-20 token to be recovered.
    /// @param tokenAmount The amount of the token to be recovered.
    function recoverERC20(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 tokenAmount
    ) external onlyOwner {
        if (rewardData[tokenAddress].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert ActiveReward(); // Ensure the token is not currently active as a reward.
        if (tokenAddress == stakingToken) revert WrongRecoveryToken(); // Prevent recovery of the staking token.
        IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(owner(), tokenAmount); // Transfer the specified amount of the token to the contract owner.
        emit Recovered(tokenAddress, tokenAmount); // Emit an event to log the recovery operation.
    }
```

## Impact
Funds of users who are blacklisted cant be recovered from the contract ever.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Create an implementation of 'recoverERC20` for blacklisting tokens.
- Implement a mechanism that allows users to claim token-specific rewards.
- As the no of users who gets blacklisted are pretty low there is no need for a permissionless mechanism for that instead `owner` can claim their rewards and forward it to them.
