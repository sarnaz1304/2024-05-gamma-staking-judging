# penaltyFactor will round down to 0 for an edge case.

## Summary
The penaltyFactor is calculated as 
`penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;`
If at all the value (unlockTime - block.timestamp) falls below 75 (i.e) just 75 seconds before the unlockTime of our lockedBalance. There will be no `timePenaltyFraction`  imposed.

## Vulnerability Detail
let lockPeriod = 30 days (2592000)
unlockTime - block.timestamp = 75 
timePenaltyFraction = 35000 (35%)
basePenaltyPercentage = 15000 (15%)

penaltyFactor = (74) * 35000 / 2592000 + 15000   
              =0 + 15000

if user locked amount = *100 tokens* then, 
penaltyAmount = 100 * 15000 / 100000 = **15 TOKENS** 
## Impact
Bypassing of timePenaltyFraction just a minute before unlockTime.
