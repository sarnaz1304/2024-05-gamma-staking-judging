# # A Malicious User can call `exitLateByID()` to exit early without any penalty.

## Summary
Due to no time constraint on the exit functions, a malicious user can exit early without any penalty via calling `earlyExitById().
## Vulnerability Detail
Users who intend to exit early should call `earlyExitById()`, they are penalized for exiting early which will prompt them not to exit at all, however if a user intends to exit early, the user can do so without any penalty via calling the `earlyExitById()` since there is no check as to the time the user is exiting in the function.

```solidity
    function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        if (isEarlyExitDisabled) {
            revert EarlyExitDisabled();
        }
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);
..SNIP..

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
    //@audit anyone can call `exitLateByID()` to exit early without any penalty
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }

```solidity
//@audit there is no check as to the time the user is exiting
   function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

        // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
        uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
        bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

        locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

        emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
    }
```

## Impact
Loss of fees for penalty that should have been generated for the protocol

## Recommendation
Add a check to disallow users from calling `exitLateByID()` when they're exiting early.
