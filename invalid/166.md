# User Might Lose Rewards Under A Certain Edge Case

## Summary

Under a certain edge case (User stakes and exits in between notifyRewards) will loose his rewards. This is explained via a coded PoC.

NOTE:  This is different from the MEV case defined in accepted risks , there the user is sandwiching the notify reward , but here the user is the victim himself due to timing.

## Vulnerability Detail

The below PoC depicts the scenario where the user stakes and exits (exits after 1 day) in between two notify reward calls(paste this PoC in Withdraw.t.sol and import console log for outputs) ->

```solidity
function test_PoC3() public {
        // Users stake tokens

        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);


        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);
        
        // Fetch the first lock for user1 and perform a late exit
        LockedBalance[] memory user1Locks = lockList.getLocks(user1, 0, 10);
        LockedBalance memory user1Lock = lockList.getLockById(user1, user1Locks[0].lockId);


        vm.prank(user1);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        lock.exitLateById(user1Lock.lockId);

        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 300);
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        console.log("Rewards: " , _rewardToken.balanceOf(user1));


}
```

You can see user stakes --> waits one day (notify rewards has not been called yet) --> exits the stake --> notifyUnseenRewards() --->
User got 0 reward tokens for his stake which was 1 day long.

## Tool used

Foundry , Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have a minimum period during which users can't exit (within which a notifyUnseenReward() would be called).
