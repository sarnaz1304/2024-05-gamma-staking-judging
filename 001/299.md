# exiting early will cause accumulated rewards for staker to be lost

## Summary
exiting early will cause accumulated rewards for staker to be lost, because after user calls `earlyExitById` his bal.lockWithMultiplier will be set to 0 causing his rewards in earned  to get multiplied by 0  causing loss of funds for the user 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        if (isEarlyExitDisabled) {
            revert EarlyExitDisabled();
        }
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);

        if (lock.unlockTime != 0)
            revert InvalidLockId();
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockId);
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
        lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
        bal.locked -= lock.amount;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier; //here balance for user gets set back to 0

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender);

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }
```
After user calls `earlyExitById` his bal.lockWithMultiplier will be set to 0 causing his rewards in `earned`  to get multiplied by 0  making unable for user to get his rewards 

```solidity
    function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```

Implement a check if the staker  has called `exitEarlyById` or not
