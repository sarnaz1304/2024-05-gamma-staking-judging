# The user will be able to get more rewards than he is supposed to get.

## Summary
The user will get much more funds from the rewards than he is supposed to get and this will drain the protocol by a lot.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say that the user staked 50 tokens and the multiplier is 2 so he has 100 tokens in his `lockedWithMultiplier` balance. When the user staked his tokens his `rewardDebt` was calculated with the `_updateRewardDebt` function. For the sake of this calculation let's say that the `cumulatedReward` had a value of 500. The calculation will be done in the following way:
```solidity
rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
```
So the `rewardDebt` for the user will be equal to `500*100=50000`.

Now if we assume that everything went well in the functions that need to be called for the user to get his funds after the 30-day period mark and the 30 days passed, the user is now eligible to receive his reward. The user now calls the `getReward` function and the next thing happens.
```solidity
function getReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) public nonReentrant {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any accrued rewards up to the current point for the caller.
        _getReward(msg.sender, _rewardTokens); // Calls the internal _getReward function to process the actual reward claim.
    }
```

This function first calls the `_updateReward` function. The function is represented in the next way:
```solidity
   function _updateReward(address account) internal {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Determine the number of reward tokens.
        Balances storage bal = balances[account]; // Access the balance record for the user.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = rewardTokens[i]; // Access each token.
            Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[token]; // Get the reward data for the token.

            rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token); // Update the rewards for the user based on what has been earned so far.
            rewardDebt[account][token] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier; // Update the reward debt based on the latest reward information.

            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

Now the `_updateReward` function sets the rewards for the user by calling the `_earned` function. The `_earned` function is as follows:
```solidity
 function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```
Now this function sets the earnings for the user as the math is above. The problem lies in the calculation because the `rewardDebt` is not updated for the user prior to this, it's still 50000 and the `lockedWithMultiplier` balance for the user is still 100. But the `cumulatedReward` is updated more frequently. If we assume that the cumulatedReward changed its value from 500 to 520 in the meantime the result of the earning will be `520 * 100 - 50000` which will be equal to 2000. So the reward for the user will be set to 2000. 

After all this happens the `getReward` function calls the `_getReward` function which is represented in the next way:
```solidity
 function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token. 
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

```
So now the reward for the user is 2000 and let's say it is 2000e36. ` IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36);` when this line happens the reward for the user transferred to him will be `2000e36/1e36` which will be 2000 worth of that token which is much more than the user is supposed to get. If the protocol is working this way many users will by able to drain the protocol by getting a lot more funds than they are supposed to be able to get.

## Impact
The user will end up with much more funds than he is supposed to get from the rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the `rewardDebt` in the `getReward` function for the user again, before calculating the earnings from the rewards he gets.
