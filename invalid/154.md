# Protocol is unable to distribute rewards in same token type that users have staked

## Summary
Protocol can't use the staking token as a reward token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol admin [can't whitelist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L169-L176) `stakingToken ` to be a valid `rewardToken`. This is due to the  check from `addReward` which prevents the distribution of rewards in the same token that is utilized for staking purposes.

```solidity
    /// @notice Adds a new token to the list of reward tokens that will be distributed to stakers.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the contract owner and checks for validity of the reward token before adding.
    /// @param _rewardToken The address of the token to be added as a reward token.
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
@>        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
...
```
Contest readme or provided documentation doesn't mention this limitation. 
This issue is created in the context of  Sponsor's comment that staking token will be GAMMA and reward token will be Weth or GAMMA token:
```txt
In practice, it will be staking GAMMA, and earn WETH and/or GAMMA.  
But we could allow for other standard ERC-20 tokens that are neither rebasing or fee-on-transfer.

## Impact
The admin is unable to distribute rewards in the same token type that users have staked.

## Recommendation
Consider removing `rewardToken == stakingToken` check from `addReward` function : 

```solidity
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
-        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
+        if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();

        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
...
```
