# Incorrect Calculation in claimableRewards Function

## Summary
The claimableRewards function double-counts rewards

## Vulnerability Detail

The claimableRewards function in the Lock contract incorrectly calculates the claimable rewards by double-counting the rewards. The issue arises from the following line:
```solidity
rewardsData[i].amount = (_earned(account, rewardsData[i].token) + rewards[account][rewardTokens[i]]) / 1e36;
```
Here, the function adds the result of _earned(account, rewardsData[i].token) to rewards[account][rewardTokens[i]]. However, the rewards[account][rewardTokens[i]] already includes the value calculated by _earned(account, rewardsData[i].token) due to the _updateReward function, which updates rewards[account][token] as follows:
```solidity
rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token);
```
Thus, the claimableRewards function ends up double-counting the rewards, leading to an incorrect calculation.


## Impact

The issue causes users to see inflated claimable rewards, leading to incorrect reward expectations.
