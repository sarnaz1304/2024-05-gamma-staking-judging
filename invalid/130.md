# `earlyExitById` will revert if treasury address is not set

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Lock::earlyExitById` function transfers penalty fees to a `treasury` address. 
The initialize function does not set this address, relying on the contract owner to set it later via `setTreasury`.
If forgotten, `Lock::earlyExitById` function will revert.

## Impact
Users won't be able to early exit.
