# Protocol doesn't account properly for the award distribution if one the reward tokens is fee-on-transfer token.

## Summary

As stated in the protocol's README: "The tokens we expect to interact with would be standard ERC-20 tokens. The reward tokens will also be standard ERC-20 tokens". In case a fee-on-transfer token is added as a reward token like `STA` or `PAXG`, this oversight can result in inaccuracies in reward calculations, potential loss of rewards for users, and discrepancies in the protocolâ€™s accounting. Since the `Lock::_getReward` function perform operation based on recorded amounts. It doesn't query the existing balance of tokens before or after sending in order to properly account for tokens that shift balance when transfered.

```javascript
    function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

@>          uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

@>              IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

An example, im excluding the iteration and the division by `1e36` for simplicity:

1. Assume Alice has accrued 100 tokens as reward for long staking the GAMMA token.
2. The token has a 5% fee on transfer
3. Alice receives 95 tokens instead of her actual reward, but in the protocol's recordings it will be counted as the full amount

## Impact

The protocol's reward distribution logic is not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens, which causes loss of rewards for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Clearly state in the docs that fee-on-transfer tokens won't be implemented or adjust the code to check the token.balanceOf() before and after doing any operation related to it's distribution to users.
