# An attacker can DoS the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` in `Lock.sol` for a user

## Summary
An attacker can DoS the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function by creating locks on behalf of another user, which will result in a DoS of this function because it reads from storage on every iteration.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function iterates over all locks and withdraws the total unlocked amount. The function uses `lockList` variable which reads from storage on every iteration in the while loop. We can see this here:
```solidity
  function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
        uint256 page;
        uint256 limit;
        uint256 totalUnlocked;

        while (limit < lockCount) {
>           LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(
                msg.sender,
                page,
                lockCount
            ); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (
                    lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 &&
                    lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp
                ) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }

            limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
            page++;
        }

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
        emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
    }

```
 The problem is that everyone can create a lock for another user through the `stake` function. An attacker can just create thousands of locks with `amount` of 1 wei of `stakingToken`. This way the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` will have to iterate through everyone of them which will be impossible because the transaction will be really expensive in terms of gas.

## Impact
This will result in DoS of the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` for a user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The easiest way to solve this is by adding a minimum amount that needs to be staked to create a lock. This way it will be much more expensive for the attacker to perform the griefing attack.
