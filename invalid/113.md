# Loss of Funds (gas fees on transaction) when using the `function stake()` while `stakingToken` is not set.

## Summary
When the user tries to stake the token from `Lock.sol` which is not set then there will be a revert on transferring the tokens where user will incur loss of funds in the form of gas fees for the transaction which is not good for the scaling of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
After the initialization of the contract `Lock.sol` if someone just call the `function stake()` before `function setStakingToken()` is called , then there will be no staking of the tokens because the `safeTransferFrom` will revert the call as the address is **Zero Address** . Because there is no contract to be transfer as of now before setting up the **Staking Token**. 

## Impact
When the user tries to `stake()`before the `function setStakingToken()`  the call to `safeTransferFrom` will revert, causing the entire _stake transaction to fail Because the `safeTransferFrom` will not support **Zero Address** which will cause loss of funds in the form of gas fees to the user which is not good for the value of the protocol in the ecosystem. There will no loss of the tokens but the user will incur loss in the form of the gas fees which is being used during the transaction call.

## Code Snippet
Made the following changes mentioned in the **Recommendation** here in this function : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L260C1-L307

## Recommendation
To prevent this issue, ensure that the stakingToken is set to a valid ERC20 token address before allowing staking operations. This can be done by adding a check at the beginning of the _stake function

```diff
+ if (stakingToken == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); 
```
