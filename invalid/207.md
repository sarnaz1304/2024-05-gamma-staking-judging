# Integer overflow when calculating rewards


## Summary

The protocol uses a Sushi Masterchef like method for maintaining rewards for each user. The `cumulatedReward` variable is used for keeping track of the accumulated amount of assets per staking token. However, since `cumulatedReward` is scaled by 1e36, it may lead to overflow during reward calculation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's see how the reward is calculated:

1. `cumulatedReward` is maintained as the cumulative asset/share ratio scaled by 1e36.
2. Earned rewards and rewardDebt are calculated by `cumulatedReward` times the amount of shared token (with multiplier)

The issue here is `cumulatedReward` is scaled by 1e36, which is too large, and is susceptible to grief attacks. An example is:

1. At the beginning of the Lock contract, attacker initially stakes 1 wei of staking token, and deposits 1e18 reward token.
2. Attacker calls `notifyUnseenReward()` to accumulate the reward. The `cumulatedReward` is now 1e18 * 1e36 / 1 = 1e54.
3. Then, when calculating the earned rewards, if anyone has 1e18 staking tokens, the reward calculation (and the reward debt) would be up to 1e54 * 1e18 = 1e72.

Note that uint256.max is around 1e78, and the limit would be easily hit if the tokens in step 1 and step 3 is 1000e18 instead of 1e18.

```solidity
    function _notifyReward(address _rewardToken, uint256 reward) internal {
        if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier == 0)
            return; // If there is no locked supply with multiplier, exit without adding rewards (prevents division by zero).

        Reward storage r = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Accesses the reward structure for the specified token.
>       uint256 newReward = reward * 1e36 / lockedSupplyWithMultiplier; // Calculates the reward per token, scaled up for precision.
>       r.cumulatedReward += newReward; // Updates the cumulative reward for the token.
        r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.
        r.balance += reward; // Increments the balance of the token by the new reward amount.
    }

    ...

    function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
>       earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }

```

## Recommendation

Couple of ways for mitigation:

1. Use 1e12 as scale factor (like in [Masterchef](https://github.com/sushiswap/masterchef/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol#L56)) instead of 1e36.
2. Since the staking token is always [GAMMA](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6bea7cfef803d1e3d5f7c0103f7ded065644e197) (which has 18 decimals) and is currently priced at $0.117, the `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` can be initially set to 1e18 to avoid `cumulatedReward` to be too large. The loss is be negligible for initial stakers.
3. Add a minimum staking amount limit (e.g. 1e18).
