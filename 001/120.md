# Setting `lock.unlockTime` in earlyExitById function will not work

## Summary
In the `earlyExitById` function in the `Lock.sol`, the setting of lock.unlockTime will not 
## Vulnerability Detail
The memory keyword in Solidity is used to allocate temporary storage for variables during the execution of a function. Unlike storage, which persists across function calls and transactions, memory is cleared after the execution of the function ends. In this case the lock is declared as memory `LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);`, when it should be storage, since we try to update the `lock.unlockTime` by `lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;`.

## Impact
Incorrect use of memory

```Solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        if (isEarlyExitDisabled) {
            revert EarlyExitDisabled();
        }
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);

        if (lock.unlockTime != 0)
            revert InvalidLockId();
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockId);
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
        lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
        bal.locked -= lock.amount;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender);

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);` to `LockedBalance storage lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);` in the `earlyExitById` function
