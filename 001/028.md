# User can `exitLateById` multiple times for the same lock `Id`

## Summary

`Lock.exitLateById(uint256 id))` can be called multiple times with the same `lockId` which will result in decrease of user's rewards when they have multiple locks active.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Lock.exitLateById(uint256 id))` doesn't check if the corresponding lock for the `id` was already exited. 

This leads to multiple user's balance-related storage variables changes:

```solidity
Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
bal.locked -= lock.amount;
bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
```

Especially problematic update is the: 
```solidity
bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
```

when there are multiple staking positions open. For example:

User has 2 open positions (locks):
- Id = 0 | Staked Amount = 100  | Multiplier = 3
- Id = 1  | Staked Amount = 1       | Multiplier = 2

```solidity
bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 300 + 2
```

`N > 1` exits with `Id = 1` leads to 
```solidity
bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 302 - N*2
```
instead of:
```solidity
bal.lockedWithMultiplier = 302 - 1*2
```

Which leads to wrong (smaller) total reward earning calculation inside `_updateReward(...)` function inside `getReward(...)` function call if there was an additional rewards sent to the `Lock` contract (after multiple late exits) and the contract was notified of those rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Enforce only one call to `Lock.exitLateById(uint256 id))` by adding the check:

```solidity
require(lockedBalance.exitedLate == false, "This lock was already exited late!");
```
