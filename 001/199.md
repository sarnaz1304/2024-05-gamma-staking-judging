# Attacker will front-run DoS notifyUnseenReward calls resulting in out of gas reverts.

## Summary

In contest README it is stated that 

> The reward tokens will be sent periodically to the staking contract and function notifyUnseenRewards() will be called.
> 

An attacker will front-run this transaction by sending 1 token of each reward token into the protocol, which will cause the `notifyUnseenRewards()` function to do extra computations, reads, writes and calls.

## Vulnerability Detail

Taking a detailed look into the `notifyUnseenRewards()` function: 

```solidity
function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
                _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
            }
        }
    }
```

notice that the function parameter is an array for all the reward tokens that will be deposited into the protocol on a daily basis. This function will loop through this array and call `_notifyUnseenReward()` function for each reward token.

Taking a look at the `_notifyUnseenReward()` function:

```solidity
function _notifyUnseenReward(address token) internal {
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); // Ensures the token address is not zero.
        Reward storage r = rewardData[token]; // Accesses the reward data for the given token.
        uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.

        if (unseen > 0) {
            _notifyReward(token, unseen); // Updates the reward data if there are new rewards.
        }

        emit NotifyUnseenReward(token, unseen); // Emits an event to log the notification of unseen rewards.
    }
```

notice that this function will only call `_notifyReward()` function if the reward token balance of the protocol has changed since the last time at [[lines 476-478](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L476-L478)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L476-L478). 

Notice that `_notifyReward()` function will read from storage, write into the storage and do extra computations when it is called:

```solidity
function _notifyReward(address _rewardToken, uint256 reward) internal {
        if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier == 0)
            return; // If there is no locked supply with multiplier, exit without adding rewards (prevents division by zero).

        Reward storage r = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Accesses the reward structure for the specified token.
        uint256 newReward = reward * 1e36 / lockedSupplyWithMultiplier; // Calculates the reward per token, scaled up for precision.
        r.cumulatedReward += newReward; // Updates the cumulative reward for the token.
        r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.
        r.balance += reward; // Increments the balance of the token by the new reward amount.
    }
```

Considering this, an attacker will send 1 token of each reward token that is being sent to the protocol to force all `notifyUnseenRewards()` calls to make more calculations, reads from the storage, writes to the storage and function calls resulting in the `notifyUnseenRewards()` call to revert with an out of gas error. Effectively causing the protocol to never update its rewards. This vulnerability gets easier to exploit when more reward tokens are added into the protocol.

## Impact

Impact: High
Likelihood: Low
Attacker will cause `notifyUnseenRewards()` to revert, protocol will not be able to update its rewards and users that unlock during this time will miss out on the rewards they have earned through locking their tokens.

## Code Snippet

[[Lines 504-511](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L504-L511)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L504-L511)

```solidity
function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
                _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the if check in [[line 476](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L476)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L476) in the `_notifyUnseenReward()` function so it does not enter the if check if the change in balance is too little. An example shown below:

```solidity
function _notifyUnseenReward(address token) internal {
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); // Ensures the token address is not zero.
        Reward storage r = rewardData[token]; // Accesses the reward data for the given token.
        uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.

        if (unseen > 5e17) {
            _notifyReward(token, unseen); // Updates the reward data if there are new rewards.
        }

        emit NotifyUnseenReward(token, unseen); // Emits an event to log the notification of unseen rewards.
    }

```

This change will discourage attackers since the cost of attack will be too much with nothing to gain.
