# Penalty amount would be higher for a staker who stakes for a longer duration compared to a staker who stakes for a shorter period

## Summary
- Penalty amount would be higher for a staker who stakes for a longer duration compared to a staker who stakes for a shorter period
## Vulnerability Detail
- Penalty amount would be higher for a staker who stakes for a longer duration compared to a staker who stakes for a shorter period.
- Let's understand through an example.
- Alice stakes his1e18 assets for 30 days and Bob also stakes his 1e18 for 30 days and they both have same multiplier.
- Here defaultRelockTime = 30 days
- After 20 days Alice  withdraw his stake assests through `earlyExitById()` , she would be imposed 10days * 35% / 30 days + 15% = 11.6 + 15% = 26.6 % on his staked amount.
- Now Bob withdraws his stake after 31 days of staking through `earlyExitById()` , he would be imposed 29 days * 35% / 30 days + 15% = 33.8% on his staked amount.
- Even after staking for more days he has to pay more penalty.

## Impact
- Bob has to pay more penalty amount even though he had staked his amount for longer duration than Alice.
- Even though Bob had completed his LockDuration he would pay more penalty than Alice who didn't even complete his LockDuration.

## Recommendation
- Change the logic of penalty amount  when staked duration has been completed .
