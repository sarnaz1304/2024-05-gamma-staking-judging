# High_02_Loss_Of_Funds

## Summary
The audit identified an issue in the smart contract where the order of function calls `exitLateById` and `notifyUnseenReward` affects the user's reward balance. Specifically, users do not receive their stake rewards if they exit late before unseen rewards are notified.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the handling of user exits and reward notifications. When a user calls `exitLateById` before `notifyUnseenReward`, their rewards are not updated correctly, leading to a loss of their due rewards. Conversely, if `notifyUnseenReward` is called before `exitLateById`, the rewards are processed as expected. This inconsistency indicates a flaw in how the contract manages reward calculations relative to user exits.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that users who exit late before unseen rewards are notified will not receive their due rewards. This can lead to loss of funds for users and undermines the trust and reliability of the staking mechanism.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
    _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

    LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.

    // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
    uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
    locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

    // Reduce the locked supply and the user's locked balance with and without multiplier.
    uint256 multiplierBalance = lockedBalance.amount * lockedBalance.multiplier;
    lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    lockedSupply -= lockedBalance.amount;
    Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
    bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= multiplierBalance;
    bal.locked -= lockedBalance.amount;

    locklist.setExitedLateToTrue(msg.sender, id);

    _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); // Recalculates reward debt after changing the locked balance.

    emit ExitLateById(id, msg.sender, lockedBalance.amount); // Emits an event logging the details of the late exit.
}

function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
    uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
            _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
        }
    }
}
```
## Tests demonstrating the issue:
```solidity
function testUserExitLateAfterNotifyUnseen() public {
    // Users stake tokens
    vm.prank(user1);
    lock.stake(100, user1, 0);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.stake(100, user2, 0);
    vm.prank(user3);
    lock.stake(100, user3, 0);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300);
    vm.prank(user2);
    LockedBalance[] memory locks = lockList.getLocks(user2, 0, 10);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.exitLateById(locks[0].lockId);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 11);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.getAllRewards();
    assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 0);
}

function testUserExitLateBeforeNotifyUnseen() public {
    // Users stake tokens
    vm.prank(user1);
    lock.stake(100, user1, 0);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.stake(100, user2, 0);
    vm.prank(user3);
    lock.stake(100, user3, 0);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300);
    vm.prank(user2);
    LockedBalance[] memory locks = lockList.getLocks(user2, 0, 10);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.exitLateById(locks[0].lockId);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 11);
    vm.prank(user2);
    lock.getAllRewards();
    assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 100);
}
```

Both tests fail. In the first one the balance is equal to 100 when we expect 0, in the second one the balance is equal to 0 when we expect 100. The only difference between the two tests is the order in which we are calling `Lock::notifyUnseenReward` and `Lock::exitLateById`. 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, ensure that rewards are consistently updated regardless of the order in which `Lock::exitLateById` and `Lock::notifyUnseenReward` are called. This can be done by modifying the reward update logic to correctly account for pending rewards whenever a user exits late or unseen rewards are notified.
