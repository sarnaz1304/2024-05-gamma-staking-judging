# memory used instead of storage in `earlyExitById`

## Summary
function `earlyExitById` tries to set `unlockTime` for lock on `block.timestamp + coolDownSecs` but gets gets back to 0 after function execution, because memory is used instead of storage;

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        if (isEarlyExitDisabled) {
            revert EarlyExitDisabled();
        }
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);

        if (lock.unlockTime != 0)
            revert InvalidLockId();
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        //here lock.unlockTime should be set to some value, but this will value will get back to 0 after function gets executed
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs; 
        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockId);
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
        lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
        bal.locked -= lock.amount;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender);

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }
```
In the code above, function `exitEarlyById` tries to change the value of unlockTime for lock but its value will get back to 0 after code execution which is not intended. This issue exists, because function `exitEarlyById` uses memory instead of storage for data allocation.

## Impact
Medium, because there are no funds at risk

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
change `LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);` to `LockedBalance storage lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);`
