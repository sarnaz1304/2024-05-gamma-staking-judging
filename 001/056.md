# User can lose their locked token by calling exitLateById function

## Summary
The `exitLateById` function allows a user to execute a late exit from a lock.
However, the function does not check if it's already exited or not.
If the user calls this function multiple times, the user can lose their locked tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349
```solidity
    function testExitLateById() public {
        vm.startPrank(user2);

        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 0);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 0);

        assertEq(lock.getBalances(user2).locked, 200e18);
    
        lock.exitLateById(0);
        assertEq(lock.getBalances(user2).locked, 100e18);

        lock.exitLateById(0); // @audit This line is not checked if it's already exited or not.
        assertEq(lock.getBalances(user2).locked, 0e18); // locked amount is zero

        vm.expectRevert();
        lock.exitLateById(1); // @audit can't exit by id 1
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact
User can lose their locked tokens by calling the exitLateById function multiple times.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to add the check if the exitedLate is already true or not.

```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any pending rewards for the caller before proceeding.

        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, id); // Retrieves the lock details from the lock list as a storage reference to modify.
+        require(lockedBalance.exitedLate == false, "Lock: Already exited late");

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
        locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);

```
