# Flawed Pagination Logic in withdrawAllUnlockedToken Function

## Summary
The withdrawAllUnlockedToken function contains a pagination mechanism intended to process user locks in batches. However, due to the increment of limit by 10 after each batch, the function may fail to process all locks if the total lockCount is not a multiple of the batch size.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function uses a while loop with the condition limit < lockCount to determine when all locks have been processed. Inside the loop, limit is increased by 10 after processing each batch. If lockCount is not a multiple of 10, the final batch of locks (less than 10) will not be processed, as limit will surpass lockCount.

## Impact
Users may not be able to withdraw all their unlocked tokens due to some locks being skipped, leading to funds remaining in the contract unintentionally. This could result in user dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adjust the pagination logic to ensure all locks are processed. Consider using a for loop that increments by 1, or ensure that limit correctly accounts for the total number
