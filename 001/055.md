# The `_notifyUnseenReward` function doesn't correctly update the unseen variable.

## Summary
In the `_notifyUnseenReward` function the `unseen` variable is not correctly updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is the calculation that is done in the function:
```solidity
 uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.
```
This takes the whole balance for that exact token and reduces it by the reward balance amount. Let's say the balance of the address for that token is 1000 and the reward balance is 400. This will assign a value of 600 to the unseen variable which will not be correct because the funds in the balance of the address are not all funds for rewards. This will then lead to a wrong calculation in the `_notifyReward` function.

## Impact
The protocol will notify for more rewards than there actually are.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Assign the value of rewards that need to be paid out for that token to the unseen variable.
