# Permanent Token Lockup Vulnerability in Lock.sol Stake Function

## Summary

The `stake` function in the `Lock.sol` contract allows users to specify an `onBehalfOf` address, enabling staking on behalf of another user. However, this flexibility can be exploited to stake tokens on behalf of the `Lock.sol` contract itself, resulting in the permanent loss of those tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `stake` function allows users to stake tokens on behalf of any address specified by the `onBehalfOf` parameter. If users set this parameter to the address of the `Lock.sol` contract, the tokens will be staked on behalf of the contract. Since the contract does not have mechanisms to withdraw staked tokens, these tokens become permanently inaccessible.

The `stake` function is implemented as follows:

```solidity
function stake(
  uint256 amount,
  address onBehalfOf,
  uint256 typeIndex
) external override {
  _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
}
```

## Impact

Users can unintentionally or maliciously lock their tokens permanently by staking on behalf of the `Lock.sol` contract address. This results in the irreversible loss of staked tokens, causing financial loss and potential trust issues in the platform.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerable code snippet is as follows:
[Line 245](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L245)

```solidity
function stake(
  uint256 amount,
  address onBehalfOf,
  uint256 typeIndex
) external override {
  _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent users from staking tokens on behalf of the `Lock.sol` contract itself, add a check to ensure the `onBehalfOf` address is not the contract address:

```solidity
function stake(
  uint256 amount,
  address onBehalfOf,
  uint256 typeIndex
) external override {
  require(
    onBehalfOf != address(this),
    "Cannot stake on behalf of the contract itself"
  );

  _stake(amount, onBehalfOf, typeIndex, false);
}
```

This change ensures that users cannot stake tokens on behalf of the contract, preventing the permanent loss of staked tokens.
