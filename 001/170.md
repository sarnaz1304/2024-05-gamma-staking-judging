# Loss of Rewards for User Due to Failure to Update Rewards Before Claiming

## Summary
Users may lose out on rewards because the getReward() function does not update unseen rewards before distributing them. This means the rewards calculation might miss some rewards, leading to users receiving less than they should get.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getReward()` function is intended to distribute rewards for staked tokens. The `notifyUnseenReward()` function checks and updates unseen rewards for a list of reward tokens. However, when calling `getReward()`, the function does not verify whether all rewards have been accounted for. As a result, users may receive a lesser amount of rewards than they are entitled to because unseen rewards are not included in the calculation.

## Impact
Users will not receive the full amount of rewards they are entitled to, leading to a loss of potential earnings from their staked tokens.

## Recommendation

```diff
function getReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) public nonReentrant {
+       notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens); 
        _updateReward(msg.sender); // Updates any accrued rewards up to the current point for the caller.
        _getReward(msg.sender, _rewardTokens); // Calls the internal _getReward function to process the actual reward claim.
    }
```
