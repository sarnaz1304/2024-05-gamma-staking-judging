# Acumulated reward never decreases

## Summary
Acumulated reward never decreases, causing incorrect reward calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
Claiming a reward involves calling 2 functions - the first updates the rewards, the second sends them to the user. The first function `_updateReward()` calls an `_earned()` function to determine the amount of rewards:
```solidity
rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token);
```
Here is how reward is calculated:
```solidity
earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken];
```

`rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]` updates only in `_updateReward()`: 
```solidity
rewardDebt[_user][rewardToken] = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * bal.lockedWithMultiplier;
```
`bal.lockedWithMultiplier` updates only on stake/withdraw.
`rewardInfo.cumulatedReward` can only be decreased in `_notifyReward()`:
```solidity
r.cumulatedReward += newReward;
```
Calling `getReward()` will not update none of this variables.

Here is attack scenario:
1. User calls getReward(): he receives `rewards[account][token] = _earned(account, token) = 1000`, and `rewards[account][token]` becomes 0:
```solidity
rewards[_user][token] = 0;
```
2. User calls getReward() again: `_earned(account, token)` will also return 1000, as none of these 3 variables was updated:
```solidity
rewards[account][token] += _earned(account, token);
```
3. Repeat untill drain all protocol's balance of reward token.
## Impact
Loss of funds for other users due to incorrect calculation.

## Recommendation
Properly update `rewardInfo.cumulatedReward`, consider the possibility of tracking this variable separately for each user and reduce it by the amount of rewards taken.
