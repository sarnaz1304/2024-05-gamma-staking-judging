# Pagination in withdrawAllUnlockedToken doesn't work as intended and leads to waste of Gas

## Summary
The `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function in the `Lock.sol` contract has an issue with the pagination logic, which can lead to unnecessary iterations and potential gas waste when the number of locks for a user exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, the attempt to paginate is useless as the pages will always have the same size as the total number of locks.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Lock.sol`, the [withdrawAllUnlockedToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L409) function uses a pagination mechanism to retrieve and process locks for a user. However, the implementation of the pagination logic is flawed. Instead of iterating over the correct number of pages and locks based on the lock count, the function iterates `lockCount * ceil(lockCount/10)` total times, which can lead to excessive iterations and gas consumption when the lock count is larger than 10.

For example, if a user has 11 locks, the function will iterate 22 total times instead of the expected 11 iterations (2 pages). Similarly, if a user has 100 locks, the function will iterate 1000 total times instead of the expected 100 iterations.

Additionally, the attempt to paginate is useless as the `locklist.getLocks` function retrieves all locks for the user regardless of the page size specified. This means that the pages will always have the same size as the total number of locks, rendering the pagination mechanism unnecessary.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is a potential gas waste for users with a large number of locks. The excessive iterations and unnecessary pagination can lead to higher gas costs, making the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function inefficient and potentially prohibitively expensive for users with many locks.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function testLockListOveriterates() public {
        // Simulating deposits by three different users
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        // User has 11 locks and it will iterate 22 times
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);
        lock.stake(10e18, user1, 1);

        // Apply to exit late
        lock.exitLateById(0);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 20 days);

        lock.withdrawAllUnlockedToken();

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the pagination logic can be removed entirely from the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function, as it serves no purpose and only adds unnecessary complexity and potential gas waste.

Here's an example of how the function could be simplified:

```solidity
function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
    uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender);
    uint256 totalUnlocked;

    LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, 0, lockCount);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
        if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
            totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount;
            locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId);
        }
    }

    // Transfer the total unlocked amount to the user
    ...
}
```

In this simplified implementation, the function retrieves all locks for the user in a single call to `locklist.getLocks` and iterates over them without any pagination logic. This approach is more straightforward, avoids unnecessary complexity, and eliminates the potential for gas waste due to excessive iterations or useless pagination.

By implementing this recommendation, you can ensure that the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function operates efficiently and avoids unnecessary gas waste, while also improving the code's readability and maintainability.
