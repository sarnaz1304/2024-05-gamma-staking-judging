# Unfair Reward Distribution in `Lock.sol`

## Summary
The Reward Token distribution mechanism in the smart `Lock` contract is susceptible to front-running, allowing users to gain an unfair advantage by staking their tokens right before the rewards are distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided code snippet, users can monitor the contract's state and deposit funds right before the reward distribution occurs by calling [notifyUnseenReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L504) on the `Lock` contract. This allows them to receive a disproportionately large share of the rewards compared to users who have been staking for a longer period.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is a violation of the fairness principle, as users can manipulate the system to receive more rewards than they should be entitled to based on their staking duration. This can lead to a loss of trust in the system and potential financial losses for users who do not engage in front-running.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function testUsersAccrueRewardsUnfairly() public {
        // Simulating deposits by three different users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100e18, user1, 1); // 100e18 staked for 20 day

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 days);

        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 1);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 days);

        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.stake(100e18, user3, 1);

        // At this point user2 has been staking for 10 days more than user 3 and user1 has been staking for 20 days more than user3

        // Distributing rewards to the staking contract
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 600e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), 0);
        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 0);
        assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 0);

        // Checking that rewards are allocated correctly
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.getAllRewards();

        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.getAllRewards();

        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.getAllRewards();

        assertGt(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), _rewardToken.balanceOf(user3));
        assertGt(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), _rewardToken.balanceOf(user2));
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the reward distribution mechanism should be redesigned to prevent front-running. One possible solution is to implement a system that calculates and distributes rewards based on the user's staking duration and amount at a specific checkpoint or snapshot in time, rather than distributing rewards based on the current state at the time of distribution. This way, users cannot gain an unfair advantage by depositing right before the distribution occurs.
