# Potential DOS in withdrawAllUnlockedToken() function if user has too many locks

## Summary
Potential DOS in **withdrawAllUnlockedToken()** function if user has too many locks.

## Vulnerability Detail
[withdrawAllUnlockedToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L409) function withdraws all currently unlocked tokens where the unlock time has passed for the calling user. Internally, it iterates through the list of all locks for the user, checks if the unlock time has passed, and withdraws the total unlocked amount.

However, this function is not properly implemented, at the very first iteration of the while loop, all of the caller's locks are retrieved:
```solidity
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); // Fetch the total number of locks for the caller.
        ...
        
        while (limit < lockCount) {
            LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
           ...
        }
```

```solidity
    function getLocks(
        address user,
        uint256 page,
        uint256 limit
    ) public view override returns (LockedBalance[] memory) {
        LockedBalance[] memory locks = new LockedBalance[](limit);
        uint256 lockIdsLength = lockIndexesByUser[user].length();

        uint256 i = page * limit;
        for (;i < (page + 1) * limit && i < lockIdsLength; i ++) {
            locks[i - page * limit]= lockById[lockIndexesByUser[user].at(i)];
        }
        return locks;
    }
```
Then each lock is checked and processed:
```solidity
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }
```
The issue arise when the caller have too many locks, it will become very expensive to deal with the locks and eventually leads to block gas limit. 

Even if a caller only has a few locks, a malicious user can create many locks (with 1 wei deposit) on behave of the caller, thus the caller will be DOSed when calls **withdrawAllUnlockedToken()** function.

## Impact
User could be DOSed when they try to withdraw all the unlocked token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Withdraw all the locks can be problematic, please consider to allow user to specify the locks they would like to withdraw.
