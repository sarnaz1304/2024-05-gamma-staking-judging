# Penalties are applied to expired locked positions when exiting early

## Summary

Penalties are applied for expired positions when during times of early exits

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause of the issue lies in how penalties are applied to expired positions via `calcPenaltyAmount()`.

```solidity
function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
    if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
    uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
    uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
    uint256 penaltyFactor;


    if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

        penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
    }
    else {
        penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
    }

    // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
    penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
}
```

In gamma's multi reward staking contract, the multi-sig controls an early exit mechanism that allows users to exit early if position has not been previously unlocked via `exitLateById()` (as noted by `unlockTime` being zero)

However, for expired positions with locking period greater than `defaultRelockTime`, users cannot exit early as intended without having a penalty applied.

The only way to exit would be `exitLateById()` wherein the automatic relock will apply which would deny user for withdrawing locked tokens for at least `defaultRelockTime` number of days (essentially locking funds for another 30 days. )

## Impact

- Broken logic for early exits for expired positions that would force users to incur an exit penalty or force users to relock positions for `defaultRelockTime`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Refactor `calcPenaltyAmount` to exclude the `else` block
- Refactor `earlyExitById` to allow exits without penalty for expired locks that does not transfer funds to the treasury
