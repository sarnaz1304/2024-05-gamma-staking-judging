# Missing whenNotPaused Modifier in Withdrawal

## Summary
The contract is expected to pause both deposit and withdrawal functions when the contract is paused. However, the withdrawal functions withdrawAllUnlockedToken() and withdrawUnlockedTokenById() are missing the whenNotPaused modifier, allowing withdrawals to occur even when the contract is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the contract is paused due to a detected vulnerability, an upgrade, or an emergency, the ability to withdraw funds remains active, 
## Impact
Loss of funds if the pause was intended to prevent withdrawals due to a discovered vulnerability.
Unfair advantage to users who withdraw during a pause, possibly affecting the token economics or reward distribution.
