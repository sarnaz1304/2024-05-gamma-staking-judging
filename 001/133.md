# `exitLateById` is missing `whenNotPaused` modifier

## Summary
`whenNotPaused` modifier is applied to `_stake`, `earlyExitById` and `_getReward` functions. 
This modifier is not applied to `exitLateById`. 
Admin can pause the contract in case a vulnerability is found that affects rewards or staked token amounts.
Users (or attackers) can call `exitLateById`  even when contract is paused to withdraw their staked token. 
  
## Vulnerability Detail
Lock contract [inherits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L21) from PausableUpgradeable and exposes externally the 
[pause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L669) and [unpause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L677) functions.

`whenNotPaused` modifier is applied to [exitEarlyById](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L313), [_stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L265) and [_getRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L541) .

User can still call [exitLateById](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L349) because this function doesn't have the `whenNotPaused` modifier. 

```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
```
Moreover, rewards are withdrawable immediately after they are added to Lock contract.
Users can withdraw rewards before the contract is paused and call permisionless the `exitLateById` and exit completely when unlockTIme expires.

## Impact
Even if protocol intended to pause the functions users can use to enter and exit the stacking contract, they can still withdraw stacked amounts by calling `whenNotPaused`.

## Recommendation
Apply `whenNotPaused` modifier to `whenNotPaused`

```diff
-        function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
+        function exitLateById(uint256 id) external whenNotPaused {
```
