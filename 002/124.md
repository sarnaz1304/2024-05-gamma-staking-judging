# Inadequate Prevention To DoS Due To Incorrect Page Logic

## Summary

In the initial audit report there was an issue reported where due to large number of lockIds there could have been a DoS , due to which page logic was introduced . But the logic has not been used correctly and the DoS issue still pertains.


## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The function `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` uses the paging logic to remove expired locks from the list.

2.) limit is supposed to be the number of elements per page , and limits keeps incrementing by 10 per iteration (this means 10 elements/locks per page) and `lockCount` is the total number of locks of the user , let's assume these are 100.

3.) Therefore the for loop is supposed to iterate per page and each page should have 10 elements (10 page * 10 elements = 100)

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }
```

4.) But , the locks are fetched incorrectly  , instead of fetching 10 locks per page we fetch all 100 locks per page ->

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L416

As you can see we do , 

`LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount);`

this means we are fetching a page with `lockCount` number of elements in it i.e. 100. Therefore iterating over all the elements at once inside getLocks.

5.) Therefore this method to prevent DoS is flawed since we are essentially doing the same thing plus we are doing it 10 times more since the for loop will keep iterating 10 times till limit exceeds lockCount , meaning it is still prone to OOG DoS.

## Recommendation

Refactor the code to 
`LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, limit);`
