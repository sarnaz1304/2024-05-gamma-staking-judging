# Lock.stakingToken can be set just once

## Summary
In [Lock.sol#L149-L157](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L149-L157) the `setStakingToken` method aims to set a new value for `stakingToken`. However, it allows to set `stakingToken` only if the previous value of `stakingToken` is `address(0)`. This implies that value can just be set once.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is the [following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L153) inside the  `setStakingToken` method:

```
Lock.sol#L153

if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();
```

So, if the value of `stakingToken` has been already set, there is no way to change it. 
We want to underline that in Discord channel, developers stated that the `stakingToken` must be set once. However, there is no documentation about it, and honestly we don't get the point of write an `onlyOwner` setter method that can be called once. It could simpler having an immutable state variable, or setting `stakingToken` value inside the initializer.

For the reasons above, we are reporting this issue assuming this method doesn't work as it should.

## Impact
The ability of the onwer to change the value of `stakingToken` can be very important. What if the `stakingToken` has been compromised in some way? Having a way to change that value makes the contract safer. Due to the fact we think this issue shows the lack of an important functionality of the contract, we are going to consider this issue as Medium.

## Code Snippet

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "./Setup.sol";

/// @title Deposit Tests for Lock
/// @dev This contract implements tests using Foundry's test framework to simulate various deposit scenarios and reward distributions.
contract DepositTest is Test, Setup {

    error AddressZero();

    function testSetLockTypeInfo() public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        vm.expectRevert(AddressZero.selector);
        lock.setStakingToken(address(_stakingToken));
    }

}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Let's remove the zero check:

```diff
    /// @notice Sets the token address that will be used for staking purposes.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the contract owner and will set the staking token 
    /// @param _stakingToken The address of the token to be used as the staking token.
    function setStakingToken(address _stakingToken) external onlyOwner {
-       if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();
+       if (_stakingToken == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        stakingToken = _stakingToken;
    
    
        emit SetStakingToken(_stakingToken);
    }
```
