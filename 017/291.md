# The interfaces don't declare all of the implemented functions in the contracts

## Summary
The interfaces don't declare all of the implemented functions in the contracts. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Both `ILock.sol` and `ILockList.sol` do not declare all the implemented functions in the contract. Some functions are not declared in the interface but used in the contracts which can lead to unexpected errors and incompatibilities between system components utilizing contracts that use these interfaces

## Impact
Incompatibilities between system components utilizing contracts that use these interfaces

## Code Snippet
This is one of the functions that is not implemented in the interface

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Declare all of the implemented functions in the contracts
