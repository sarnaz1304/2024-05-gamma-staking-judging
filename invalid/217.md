# The users balance is not set to 0 after he gets his rewards.

## Summary
The user will still have the same `lockedWithMultiplier` balance even after he gets his rewards transferred to him via the `getReward` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check in the functions if the user called `exitLateById` or `earlyExitById` prior to calling this function or if the 30-day period has passed, so the user will be able to call the `getReward` function whenever he wants because it's a public function.
 When the user calls the `getReward` function he wants to get his rewards. This function first calls the `_updateReward` function which updates his earnings with the `_earned` function. The problem lies here because he gets his earnings set to a specific amount with this math `earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken];` but the `balance.lockedWithMultiplier` is never set to 0 in this function so the user will still have his funds that are locked with a multiplier. This is the whole function:
```solidity
 function _earned(
        address _user,
        address _rewardToken
    ) internal view returns (uint256 earnings) {
        Reward memory rewardInfo = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Retrieves reward data for the specified token.
        Balances memory balance = balances[_user]; // Retrieves balance information for the user.
        earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken]; // Calculates earnings by considering the accumulated reward and the reward debt.
    }
```
After this, the `getReward` function calls the `_getReward` function which is represented in the next way:
```solidity
function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.  
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

As we can see this function sets the `rewards` for the user to 0 but that still doesn't set his `lockedWithMultiplier` balance to 0 so after some time if the user calls `getReward` again he will be able to withdraw a reward again.

## Impact
The user will be able to withdraw his rewards and still have the balance he previously had prior to getting his rewards.

## Recommendation
Set the `lockedWithMultiplier` balance of the user to 0 after calculating the earnings in the `_earned` functions.
