# In `Lock.sol::setStakingToken()` staking token address can be the same as the reward token address.

## Summary
Staking token address can be the same as the reward token address, therefore breaking the protocol invariant that is address of reward token != address of staking token. This also leads to reverts and breaking protocol functionality

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [`addReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L172) there is a check that enforces the invariant address of reward token != address of staking token, however if the reward token address is mistakenly passed into the `setStakingToken()` after setting the reward token, this will break the invariant and cause future complications.

### PoC
 1. Go to the test file `RestakeAfterLateExit.t.sol` or any staking test 
 2.  Check whther your test works alright.
 3. if it does, Delete [line 47](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/test/RestakeAfterLateExit.t.sol#L47) 
 4. Re-add your staking token with same address as your reward token after adding your reward token
 5. this is the line to add after adding reward token `lock.setStakingToken(address(_rewardToken));`

## Impact
Breaks protocol functionality and invariant.

## Code Snippet
[`setStakingToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L152-L157)

```solidity
    function setStakingToken(address _stakingToken) external onlyOwner {
        if (_stakingToken == address(0) || stakingToken != address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        stakingToken = _stakingToken;


        emit SetStakingToken(_stakingToken);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check implemented in `setStakingToken()` to prevent the staking token address from being the same the reward token address
