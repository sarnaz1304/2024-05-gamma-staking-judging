# [H-1]  Problem with Automatic Restaking in Smart Contract

## Summary
The smart contract in question allows a user to exit early through `earlyExitById` with a penalty or exit late through `exitLateById` without a penalty. However, there is a potential issue that token are automatically restaked after the `lockPeriod` for the time that is minimum of `defaultRelockTime` and `LockPeriod` . So, if a user wish to withdraw his token through `exitLateById`  they has to wait for the new duration .

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the late exit mechanism of the contract. If a user does not withdraw their tokens within the `lockPeriod`, the contract automatically restakes the tokens for the duration which is minimum of original lock period and default relock time. This automatic restaking could potentially lock the user's tokens for an unintended period of time. Also, the user cannot choose `earlyExitById` as this option will result in potential loss of their staking token. 

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant. Users who intend to withdraw their tokens after the staking period may find their tokens locked for an additional period. This could affect their liquidity and could potentially lead to loss of investment opportunities.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a mechanism that allows users to withdraw their tokens on time in the late exit scenario. One possible solution could be to add a function that allows users to set a withdrawal time. This would give users more control over their tokens and prevent unintended restaking.
