# Unable to withdraw locked tokens even when block.timestamp equals the unlock time.


## Summary

In the withdrawAllUnlockedToken and withdrawUnlockedTokenById functions, we check if locked tokens can be withdrawn using `lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp`. However, this is incorrect because if unlockTime is equal to block.timestamp, the tokens will not be unlocked, even though logically they should be.


## Vulnerability Detail
When block.timestamp reaches our unlock time, our tokens should be unlocked. However, due to the use of `<` instead of `<=`, they are not unlocked.
```solidity
        if (
            lockedBal.unlockTime != 0 && lockedBal.unlockTime < block.timestamp // <-HERE
        ) {
```
## Impact
Users are not able to withdraw locked token even they should be unlocked because of this mistake.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`<=`  should be used instead of `<`.
```solidity
        if (
            lockedBal.unlockTime != 0 && lockedBal.unlockTime <= block.timestamp // <-HERE
        ) {
```
