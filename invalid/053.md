# Incomplete Implementation of `whenNotPaused` Modifier in Functions

## Summary

Not all functions in the contract use the `whenNotPaused` modifier, meaning that when the contract is paused, some functions will remain accessible.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the natspac in `Lock::pause(...)`, pausing should affect all modifiable functions in emergency situations:

```solidity
 @>   /// @notice Pauses all modifiable functions in the contract, typically used in emergency situations.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the contract owner and triggers the internal _pause function, which sets the paused state to true.
    function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause(); // Calls the internal _pause function which enforces the pause state across the contract.
    }
```

However, not all functions implement the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing them to be used even when the contract is paused. This issue was also noted in a previous audit, but no changes were made to either the natspac or the functions:

## Impact

This inconsistency with the documentation means that some functions can still be executed during the pause state.

## Recommendation

Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to all state-modifying functions.
