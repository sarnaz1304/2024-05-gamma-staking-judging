# User might lock his funds for a lot longer than he might want

## Summary
User might lock his funds for a lot longer than he might want
## Vulnerability Detail
Users decide their lockup period upon staking using the `typeIndex` variable which fetches the values from the `lockPeriod` and `rewardMultipliers` arrays at the according index. The owner of the contract can change those values at any moment. This creates a possibility for the user to lock his funds for a lot longer than he might want.

Imagine the following scenario:
1. The `lockPeriod` and `rewardMultipliers` array are let's say, with 3 options, lockup period of 1 month, lockup period of 2 months and lockup period of a year (ignoring the multipliers as they are not important for the example)
2. User wants to stake his funds using the second option, thus he stakes with `typeIndex` of 1
3. Just before that happens, the owner of the protocol decides to change the arrays to another 3 options, lockup period of 3 months, lockup period of 1 year and a lockup period of 3 years
4. This causes the user to lock his funds for a whole year instead of just 2 months

While the owner is trusted, this issue does not rely on the owner trying to game the stakers, this can happen accidentally and in fact, over a large enough timeframe, it is almost guaranteed to happen at least once, if not many times.

## Recommendation
Let the users specify a value for the expected lock up period and multiplier.
