# Specific User Gas Griefing is possible via withdrawAllUnlockedToken

## Summary
Attacker can pollute Lock list  of specific user with small stacked amount to increase gas fees for such user.

## Vulnerability Detail
User should maintain all his Locks statuses by his own via **withdrawAllUnlockedToken()** function.
Implementation of this function can take a lot of gas to iterate trough all of list and recalculate it.
And because **stake()** function implemented in a way where you can stake on behalf of someone, it's easy for attacked to stake  some small amount for anyone and implement gas griefing in such way.


Notice: While contract still have **withdrawUnlockedTokenById()** it's not very sufficient in resolving such issue. User will need to detect such increasing gas fees, start to filter all existing locks and literally implement his own **withdrawAllUnlockedToken()** to have sufficient way to work with Gamma protocol.

## Impact
Gas Griefing for specific user/users for essential maintenance of their Locks.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
            LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }
```

```solidity
        locklist.addToList(
            onBehalfOf, 
            LockedBalance({
                lockId: 0, // This will be set inside the addToList function
                amount: amount,
                unlockTime: 0, 
                multiplier: multiplier,
                lockTime: block.timestamp,
                lockPeriod: lockPeriod[typeIndex],
                exitedLate: false
            })
        );
