# Address `treasury` isn't Initialized so `penaltyAmount` will be Sent to `address(0)` and Lost

## Summary

The `treasury` address variable isn't initialized, so if a user executes `Lock.earlyExitById()` before it's set, the `penaltyAmount` will be sent to `address(0)` and lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `treasury` address variable is used to store the address of the treasury to which the penalty taken from users exiting early is sent.

This variable isn't set in the constructor at contract deployment. It can be set later by the owner through `Lock.setTreasury()`.

```solidity
    /// @notice Assigns the specified address as the treasury for the contract.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the contract owner to set the treasury address.
    /// @param _treasury The address to be designated as the treasury.
    function setTreasury(address _treasury) external onlyOwner {
        treasury = _treasury;
        emit SetTreasury(_treasury);
    }
```

However, if a user calls `Lock.stake()` and exits early through `Lock.earlyExitById()` before the `treasury` address is set, the `penaltyAmount` will be sent to `address(0)` and lost.

```solidity
    function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        ...
        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
❌          IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
❌          IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }
```

Note that the `isEarlyExitDisabled` variable isn't initialized either, so it is set to `false` by default, allowing users to stake and exit early by default.

```solidity
    bool public isEarlyExitDisabled;
```

## Impact

Loss of funds.
