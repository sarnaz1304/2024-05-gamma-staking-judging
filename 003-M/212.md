# No slippage check for `coolDownSecs` for `exitLateById()` function

## Summary

When users wish to exit the staking process using `exitLateById`, a `coolDownSecs` is calculated. This is the number of seconds that must be passed for the lock to unlock. However, this value can vary significantly, especially near the end of a lock cycle. To prevent a larger `coolDownSecs` than expected, a slippage parameter should be introduced.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation of `coolDownSecs` is related to the current `block.timestamp`. In `calcRemainUnlockPeriod()`, when close to the end of a lock cycle, the result `defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime` will suddenly change from close to 0 to `defaultRelockTime`, which is a big difference.

The core issue is we cannot predict when the transaction will be executed. Even if the user submits the transaction 10 minutes before cycle ends hoping for a small `coolDownSecs`, the transaction may be executed 11 minutes later and ending up in the beginning of a lock cycle, which would end up in a large `coolDownSecs`.

```solidity
    function exitLateById(uint256 id) external {
        ...

        // Calculate and set the new unlock time based on the remaining cooldown period.
>       uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
>       locklist.updateUnlockTime(msg.sender, id, block.timestamp + coolDownSecs);
        ...
    }

    function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
>           return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
>           return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Users may end up with a larger `coolDownSecs` than expected when calling `exitLateById()`.
