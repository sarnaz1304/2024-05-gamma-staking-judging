# The attacker can grab all the rewards first

## Summary
If there are no stakers in the contract at the beginning, the attacker can stake immediately after the rewards are deposited into the protocol, and then obtain the entire reward.

## Vulnerability Detail
If there are no stakers in the contract initially, reward tokens are sent to the contract periodically and the [notifyUnseenReward ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L504)function is called. At this time, the [call will be revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L472) and [rewardData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L492C28-L492C38) will not be updated. After the attacker detects this, he can immediately stake 1wei and then call the notifyUnseenReward function, and he will receive all the rewards. The cost of the attack is negligible.

## Impact
If rewards are stored in the contract in advance, the attacker can take them all away.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _notifyUnseenReward(address token) internal {
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); // Ensures the token address is not zero.
        Reward storage r = rewardData[token]; // Accesses the reward data for the given token.
        uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.

        if (unseen > 0) {
            _notifyReward(token, unseen); // Updates the reward data if there are new rewards.
        }

        emit NotifyUnseenReward(token, unseen); // Emits an event to log the notification of unseen rewards.
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use safetransferFrom to transfer rewards into the contract. If there are no pledgers, the rewards will not be transferred.
