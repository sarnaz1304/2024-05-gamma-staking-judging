# Hardcoded 36 decimal divisor could lead to reward loss

## Summary

Hardcoded 36 decimal divisor is problematic for reward earnings computation

## Vulnerability Detail

The root cause lies in the hardcoded 36 decimal divisor when rewards are computed within `_getReward()`.

When users stake gamma tokens, depending on the duration of lock, the associated multiplier will be applied on their amount staked and added to the users [`bal.lockedSupplyWithMultiplier`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L277)

This variable is eventually used to compute the amount of reward earned via the [`earned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L461), where the `earnings` is computed as 

$$ earnings = cumulateReward * lockedwithMultiplier - rewardDebt $$ 

Where in:
- $cumulateReward$ = Current notified rewards in token decimals (E.g, 6 decimals if USDT is the reward token)
- $lockedWithMultiplier$ = Amount of staked gamma token with multiplier applied (18 + 18 = 36 decimals)
- $rewardDebt$ = Amount of rewards owed to user with multiplier applied (18 + 18 = 36 decimals)

When [`getReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L552) is eventually called, the amount of tokens transferred to user is computed by dividing `1e36` directly, which would scale down rewards back to the token decimals.

This indicates that 1e18 would represent 100% and a multiplier of 1, but the computed rewards associated would be unrealistic.

### Scenario 1: Multiplier greater than 1 (>1e18)

Assume the following, where 100 xgamma token is staked for 30 days with 300 USDT notified as rewards with a multiplier of 1

- `lockPeriod` = 30 days
- `lockedWithMultiplier` = 100e36
- `cumulateReward` = 300e6

`earnings` = 300e6 * 100e36 = 30000e42
`reward/1e36` = 30000e42 / 1e36 = 30000e6

Meaning with just 100 xGamma staked, a single user would earn even greater than the full 300 USDT notified as rewards. Considering the ~34.7 million of [xGamma](https://etherscan.io/token/0x26805021988f1a45dc708b5fb75fc75f21747d8c) on mainnet, this is extremely problematic. The price of xGamma : reward token would not match up either.

This issue is excerbated if multiplier is even greater than 1, meaning a single user can potentially ursup all rewards and potentially locking all other users from getting rewards permanently. 

The alternative would be to reduce the multiplier to an extremely small amount (which breaks the intentions of the multiplier being 1x, 2x, 3x) or send an extremely small amount of reward tokens (which would not incentivize staking)

### Scenario 2: Multiplier is set whole

In the [test files]() and public information by sponsor as seen [here](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1241042575381762168/1241414075863273604), the following can be assumed, where multipliers would simply be non-scaled numbers (1, 2,3 etc..)

- `lockPeriod` = 30 days
- `lockedWithMultiplier` = 100e18
- `cumulateReward` = 300e6

`earnings` = 300e6 * 100e18 = 30000e26
`reward/1e36` = 30000e26 / 1e36 = 0

You can see that rewards would easily round down unless a sufficient amount of tokens are staked. Given rewards are immediately zeroed out within [`_getReward()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking-nevillehuang/blob/main/StakingV2/test/Setup.sol#L51-L53) this means users would lose rewards permanently.

## Impact

- A single user could gain all notified rewards with a small amount of xGamma staked
- User could lose rewards permanently

## Recommendation

- Do not hardcode a 1e36 divisor
- Refactor reward accumulation logic, similar to synthethx, utilizing a rewardpertoken function
