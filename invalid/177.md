# Potential Logical Inconsistency in Staking Token Configuration

## Summary
Incorrect usage of  `if` statement will cause the contract to revert when setting new `stakingToken`
## Vulnerability Detail
The `setStakingToken` function includes an ` if` statement that checks two conditions:
* Ensures the provided `_stakingToken` address is not the zero address `(address(0))`, indicating a valid token.
* Checks if the `stakingToken` variable (which holds the previously set staking token address) is not `address(0)`.

The second condition could prevent setting a new staking token even when a valid address is provided, potentially hindering the intended functionality.
This inconsistency arises because the `stakingToken` variable is declared as` public` `override`, suggesting it's already `initialized` with a value (likely not` address(0`)) and accessible from outside the contract.

## Impact
* The function might prevent setting a valid staking token address, potentially disrupting the staking functionality of the smart contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 remove the `stakingToken != address(0)` condition from the `if` statement. This allows setting a new valid staking token address.
