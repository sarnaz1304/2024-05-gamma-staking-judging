# [M-1] `Lock::stake` - Tokens staked on behalf of the Lock contract cannot be withdrawn, leading to permanent locking of tokens

## Summary
In the `Lock` contract, the `stake` function allows users to stake tokens on behalf of another address using the `onBehalfOf` parameter. However, if the `onBehalfOf` parameter is set to the address of the `Lock` contract itself, the staked tokens become permanently locked in the contract. This is because the Lock contract does not have any mechanism to withdraw tokens staked on its own behalf, and no other account can specify the `Lock` contract's address as the `msg.sender` when calling the withdrawal functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Add the following Proof of Concepts to `Setup.sol` in the `test` folder:
```javascript
    /// @notice Tests the scenario where the Lock contract itself is provided as the onBehalfOf parameter in the stake function.
 function testStakingOnBehalfOfLockContract() public {
        uint256 stakeAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 lockIndex = 0;

        // Transfer staking tokens to the Lock contract
        vm.prank(user1);
        _stakingToken.transfer(address(lock), stakeAmount);

        // Get the initial balance of the Lock contract
        uint256 initialLockBalance = _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock));

        // Stake tokens on behalf of the Lock contract
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(stakeAmount, address(lock), lockIndex);

        // Check that the tokens are locked in the Lock contract
        assertEq(
            _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock)),
            initialLockBalance + stakeAmount,
            "Tokens are not locked in the Lock contract"
        );

        // Get the initial balance of the user
        uint256 initialUserBalance = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);

        // Attempt to withdraw the locked tokens (should not transfer any tokens)
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.withdrawAllUnlockedToken();

        // Check that no tokens were transferred to the user
        assertEq(_stakingToken.balanceOf(user1), initialUserBalance, "Tokens were unexpectedly transferred to the user");

        // Check that the tokens are still locked in the Lock contract
        assertEq(
            _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock)),
            initialLockBalance + stakeAmount,
            "Tokens are unexpectedly withdrawn from the Lock contract"
        );
    }

    /// @notice Tests that even the contract owner cannot withdraw tokens staked on behalf of the Lock contract.
    function testOwnerCannotWithdrawTokensStakedOnBehalfOfLockContract() public {
        uint256 stakeAmount = 100e18;
        uint256 lockIndex = 0;

        // Transfer staking tokens to the Lock contract
        vm.prank(user1);
        _stakingToken.transfer(address(lock), stakeAmount);

        // Get the initial balance of the Lock contract
        uint256 initialLockBalance = _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock));

        // Stake tokens on behalf of the Lock contract
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(stakeAmount, address(lock), lockIndex);

        // Check that the tokens are locked in the Lock contract
        assertEq(
            _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock)),
            initialLockBalance + stakeAmount,
            "Tokens are not locked in the Lock contract"
        );

        // Attempt to withdraw the locked tokens as the contract owner (should not transfer any tokens)
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.withdrawAllUnlockedToken();

        // Check that the tokens are still locked in the Lock contract
        assertEq(
            _stakingToken.balanceOf(address(lock)),
            initialLockBalance + stakeAmount,
            "Tokens are unexpectedly withdrawn from the Lock contract"
        );
    }
```
Run this test with `forge test --mt testStakingOnBehalfOfLockContract` and `forge test --mt testOwnerCannotWithdrawTokensStakedOnBehalfOfLockContract`

Here is a walkthrough of the tests:

`testStakingOnBehalfOfLockContract`:
This test stakes tokens on behalf of the `Lock` contract using the `stake` function with `address(lock)` as the `onBehalfOf` parameter.

It then attempts to withdraw the staked tokens using the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function, simulating a user trying to withdraw the tokens.

The test passes because no tokens are transferred to the user, proving that the tokens staked on behalf of the `Lock` contract cannot be withdrawn by users.

`testOwnerCannotWithdrawTokensStakedOnBehalfOfLockContract`:
This test stakes tokens on behalf of the `Lock` contract, similar to the previous test.

It then attempts to withdraw the staked tokens using the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function, but this time simulating the contract owner (deployer) trying to withdraw the tokens.

The test passes because the tokens remain locked in the contract even after the owner's withdrawal attempt, proving that even the contract owner cannot withdraw tokens staked on behalf of the Lock contract.

These passing tests demonstrate that tokens staked on behalf of the Lock contract become permanently locked and cannot be recovered by anyone.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows users to permanently lock tokens in the `Lock` contract by staking them on behalf of the contract itself. Once the tokens are staked in this manner, they cannot be withdrawn by anyone, including the contract owner or any other user. This can lead to a loss of funds for users who maliciously or accidentally stake tokens on behalf of the `Lock` contract, as those tokens will be permanently stuck in the contract.

Furthermore, if a significant amount of tokens are staked on behalf of the `Lock` contract, it can potentially disrupt the token ecosystem by reducing the circulating supply and liquidity of the staked token.

## Tool used
Manual Review
Foundry

## Recommendation
The `Lock` contract should implement additional checks in the `stake` function to prevent staking tokens on behalf of the contract itself. One possible solution is to add a require statement that ensures the `onBehalfOf` parameter is not equal to the address of the Lock contract. This require statement would look like this:
```javascript
function stake(uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint256 typeIndex) external override {
    require(onBehalfOf != address(this), "Cannot stake on behalf of the Lock contract");
    // ...
}
```
