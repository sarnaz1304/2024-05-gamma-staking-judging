# Reward tokens cannot be removed

## Summary
The protocol intends to have the ability to remove `reward tokens`. 

However, there currently does not exist any functionality that can do this. 

Admins will not be able to remove reward tokens as intended and users will continue to earn rewards from all `reward tokens` that were added.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contest page, the protocol mentions the following: `"Additionally, re-adding a removed reward token would corrupt the reward data. The assumption should be that once a reward token is removed, it would not be re-added in the future."`

We can see that the protocol intends to have the ability to remove tokens (and never re-add them).

Reward tokens are added the following way:

`Lock::addReward`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L172
```javascript
    /// @notice Adds a new token to the list of reward tokens that will be distributed to stakers.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the contract owner and checks for validity of the reward token before adding.
    /// @param _rewardToken The address of the token to be added as a reward token.
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```

However, there is no functionality that can remove `reward tokens`.

## Impact
There could be an important reason a protocol intends to remove a reward token (i.e, price drop). Users will continue earning rewards for these tokens despite protocol's intention to remove them.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a function with `onlyOwner` modifier that can remove reward tokens. Revert the function call if the reward token was already removed.
