# Weak PRNG

## Summary
Weak randomness in `Lock::calcRemainUnlockPeriod` allows anyone to choose winner

## Vulnerability Detail
Since block.timestamp can be influenced by miners, it's generally not suitable for generating random numbers or for critical decision-making processes where predictability is undesirable. Validators can know ahead of time the `block.timestamp` and use that knowledge to predict when / how to participate.

## Impact
The concern arises from the use of block.timestamp in combination with modulo operations, which can potentially be manipulated by miners to influence the outcome of the calculation. This manipulation could lead to predictable outcomes, undermining the intended security and fairness of the contract's logic. Using on-chain values as a randomness seed is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

## Recommendation
Consider using an oracle for your randomness like [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction).
