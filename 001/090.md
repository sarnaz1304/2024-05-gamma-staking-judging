# Lack of early exit penalty for rewards enables exploitation by short-term stakers

## Summary

The `earlyExitById` function allows users to exit their lock early and withdraw their staked tokens, subject to a penalty of up to 50% of the locked amount. However, the rewards earned are not subject to this early exit penalty. This can be exploited by short-term stakers to earn a disproportionate amount of rewards during periods of high reward distribution, then exit early while keeping all the rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`calcPenaltyAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L569-L586) function calculates the penalty for an early exit based on the remaining lock time and a base penalty percentage. The maximum penalty is [currently set to 50%](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L30-L31) of the locked amount.

However, when a user calls [`earlyExitById`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L336), the penalty is only applied to the locked token amount. The rewards earned by the user are not subject to this penalty and can be withdrawn in full.

This can be exploited in scenarios where a large amount of rewards are expected to be distributed in a short period, such as when Gamma receives a significant token grant or airdrop.

Consider this scenario:

1. Gamma is expected to receive a large token grant or airdrop and distribute it to stakers.
2. User locks are available between 1 week to 4 years, with different reward multipliers. The 4-year lock has a 200x multiplier compared to the 1-week lock.
3. Speculators buy GAMMA (the staking token) and lock it for 4 years, becoming eligible for the highest 200x multiplier.
4. The grant is deposited and immediately distributed according to the current multipliers and balances. Crucially, the staking contract [does not distribute rewards over time, but immediately](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L461).
5. Speculators withdraw their rewards (earned at the max 200x multiplier), which are pure quick profit, then call `earlyExitById`, incurring the 50% penalty on their staked GAMMA.
6. Due to the grant income and speculators buying GAMMA, the token price increases, possibly negating the 50% penalty for the speculators due to increased sale price, in addition to their reward profits.

## Impact


As a result, honest long-term stakers lose a disproportionate amount of rewards to the short-term speculators who staked only for the distribution period. GAMMA holders are also subject to price volatility as speculators buy and then sell the token in a short timeframe. 

While the risk of MEV around rewards distributions is documented in the README:

> Any MEV issues related to sending of the reward tokens are known risks. For example if a user sees a large amount of rewards being sent to the contract in the mempool, it is acceptable that another user frontruns the sending of the rewards by staking ahead of the distribution. This risk is intended to be acceptable due to the fact that we'll keep the lowest lock time at around 30 days.


The documented "known issue" is limited to MEV, and the planned mitigation - having a minimum lock-up of 30 days - only adequately deals with MEV, but fails for the described scenario. This is because any lock-up is made insufficient in that scenario by only applying early-exit penalties on the staking token and with no reward penalties, while at the same time allowing possibly very high reward multipliers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider applying the early exit penalty to the earned rewards as well, not just the locked token amount.

This could be implemented by managing rewards per-lock instead of per-user, and allowing rewards to be withdrawn only according to the proportion of the lock duration already served.

For example, if a user exits early halfway through their lock period, they would only be able to withdraw 50% of the rewards earned by that lock. The remaining rewards would be forfeited as a penalty and distributed to other stakers (via updating `cumulatedReward`).

This would discourage short-term stakers from exploiting high reward distribution periods, as the penalty would negate the incentive for such speculation and early exits.


Alternatively, if a large amount of rewards is to be distributed, ensure the distributions are spread over a long period of time.
