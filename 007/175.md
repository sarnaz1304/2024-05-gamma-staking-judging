# Missing initializer or checks for treasury may lead to loss of penalty amounts

## Summary
In case the treasury address is not initialized properly and because `earlyExitById` is missing proper checks for the treasury address if a user stakes and early exit his lock the protocol will burn the penalty amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario : 
- treasury is address(0)
- Bob stakes 100 tokens
- Bob decides to early exit his lock leading to him paying the  full penalty amount
- in `earlyExitById` there are no checks about the treasury address which will lead to the penalty fee being burned.

## Impact
Loss of penalty funds
