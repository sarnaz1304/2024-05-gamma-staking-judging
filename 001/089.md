# Some tokens  will be locked and not distributed because  of rounding error in the function  _getReward()

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Function `_getReward()`  processes and transfers the calculated rewards to the users. To calculate the reward amount, it divides the stored reward by  `1e36`, transfers the reward to the users, and updates the user's reward . But because of the rounding error in division, some of reward amount wouldn't be distributed and stucked in contract . The contract doesn't  redistributes them or  have any mechanism to recover them. This bug can be more damaging if the precision of `rewardToken`  is low or token price is high.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L538

## Proof of Concept
This is  `_getReward()`  code :

```solidity
  function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
As you can see it computes  `reward / 1e36`  which means any value of reward less than `1e36` will result zero.

If all 3 users  stake  100 each and  they  choose   `typeIndex` to be 2 as their type of locking period , some tokens will be stuck in the contract due to rounding error. Below , the function `getAllRewards()` relies on function `_getReward()` to compute the shares  

```solidity    
  function test_poc() public {
        // Simulating deposits by three different users
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.stake(100, user1, 2);
        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.stake(100, user2, 2);
        vm.prank(user3);
        lock.stake(100, user3, 2);

        // Distributing rewards to the staking contract
        vm.prank(deployer);
        _rewardToken.transfer(address(lock), 300);
        vm.prank(deployer);
        lock.notifyUnseenReward(rewardTokens);

        // Check that rewards are allocated correctly
        vm.prank(user1);
      lock.getAllRewards();
      assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user1), 99);
         vm.prank(user2);
         lock.getAllRewards();
      assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user2), 99);
      vm.prank(user3);
         lock.getAllRewards();
         assertEq(_rewardToken.balanceOf(user3), 99);
       
    }
```
As you can see  each user got 99 as reward and when added 99x3 = 297  which is not equal to 300  distributed to the   staking contract which means 3 has been stuck in the contract . There is  also  no mechanism to track and redistribute .

An attacker can also exploit this  by  looping a stake  with   `1 wei`   and choosing 0  for  `typeIndex`   to early exit the staking but there will no penalty paid because the result is  zero due to rounding error. 

Run command `forge test --mt test_poc -vvvv `

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement a minimum staking amount 
2. Small rounding errors can accumulate significantly therefore add mechanism to track , recover  and redistribute them
