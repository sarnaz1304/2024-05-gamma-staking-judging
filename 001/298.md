# The _getReward function may lose precision, resulting in the loss of the user's reward

## Summary
The _getReward function may lose precision, resulting in the loss of the user's reward

## Vulnerability Detail
Precision rounding occurs in the _getReward function

```solidity
    function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

The reward for users is not always greater than 1e36. When the reward for users is less than 1e36, the getReward function is called. Due to the rounding off of division accuracy, the amount transferred to the user may be less than the actual amount. This is especially true when the precision of rewardToken is relatively low, such as USDT with a precision of 1e6.
Also note the statement:
```solidity
rewards[_user][token] = 0;
```
The reward record representing the user has been cleared, which means that the user will lose this part of the reward forever

## Impact
The _getReward function may cause precision loss, resulting in the loss of user rewards

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Optimize code
```solidity
rewards[_user][token] = 0;
```
Change to
```solidity
rewards[_user][token] = reward % 1e36;
 ```
The purpose is to retain the remainder of the statement 'reward / 1e36' that cannot be divided evenly in the user's reward
