# Removing a reward token is impossible

## Summary
Reward tokens cannot be removed once added
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently only a function to [add a reward token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/703fd3604069489937037f20490ec8c492c0508e/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L172-L182) exists in the protocol:

```solidity
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```

There is no way to remove a reward token in the protocol once added, whilst the contest README states that such functionality is expected and intended:

>"Additionally, re-adding a **removed** reward token would corrupt the reward data. The assumption should be that once a reward token is **removed**, it would not be re-added in the future."

There can be multiple reasons why the protocol would want to remove a token, especially since the devs have already considered it, but in this case it's impossible. At first it is planned that WETH will be the reward token but the protocol communicated it is eager to experiment with adding new reward tokens. In case where integration with a new token turns out to be problematic (for whatever reason), there is no ability to roll back the changes.
## Impact
No ability to remove a reward token once added.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function addReward(address _rewardToken) external override onlyOwner {
        if (_rewardToken == address(0)) revert InvalidBurn();
        if (rewardData[_rewardToken].lastUpdateTime != 0) revert AlreadyAdded();
        if (_rewardToken == stakingToken || rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken]) revert InvalidRewardToken();
        rewardTokens.push(_rewardToken);
        rewardTokenAdded[_rewardToken] = true;

        Reward storage reward = rewardData[_rewardToken];
        reward.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit AddReward(_rewardToken);
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a mirrored function that removes a token like expected and communicated in the docs.
