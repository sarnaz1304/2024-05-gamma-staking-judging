# Passing `lockCount` instead of `10` when calling `getLocks` as limit in `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` can cause an Out of Gas error.

## Summary
In the withdrawAllUnlockedToken function, we are calling the getLocks function with lockCount instead of 10. This may seem normal, but when there is a large number of locks, it can create problems. We keep calling it repeatedly until limit < lockCount is true, looping over it and potentially causing an Out of Gas error.




## Vulnerability Detail
Scenario:

lockCount = 200
If a user calls withdrawAllUnlockedToken, it will call getLocks 20 times. Each time, we copy a 200-length array in memory and loop over it. Instead of looping 200 times, we end up looping 200 * 20 times.

lockCount = 1000
If the lockCount increases to 1000, we will loop 1000 * 100 times.

This makes it easy for an attacker to increase the lockCount by calling stake with a minimum amount, potentially causing an Out of Gas error.


## Impact
This makes withdrawAllUnlockedToken unusable for the user due to an Out of Gas error.

## Recommendation
Using 10 when calling getLocks instead of lockCount like below:  
```solidity
    function withdrawAllUnlockedToken() external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 lockCount = locklist.lockCount(msg.sender); 
        uint256 page;
        uint256 limit;
        uint256 totalUnlocked;
        
        while (limit < lockCount) {
            LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, 10); // -> HERE.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) {
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; 
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId);  
                }
            }

            limit += 10; 
            page++;
        }

        IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Transfers the total unlocked amount to the user.
        emit WithdrawAllUnlocked(msg.sender, totalUnlocked); // Emits an event logging the withdrawal.
    }
```
