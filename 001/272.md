# Malicious Actor or user itself can increase the reward Token Balance by directly sending the tokens to the Lock Contract.

## Summary
The [_notifyReward()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L477) function will be called on the basis of the whether the `unseen` is greater than Zero but sending tokens to the Lock Contract it increases the `unseen` value to atleast one then it force to call the `_notifyReward()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `notifyUnseenReward()` function is used to update the unseen rewards of specific token as the state.

```solidity
    /// @notice Checks and updates unseen rewards for a list of reward tokens.
    /// @dev Iterates through the provided list of reward tokens and triggers the _notifyUnseenReward function for each if it has been previously added to the contract.
    /// @param _rewardTokens An array of reward token addresses to check and update for unseen rewards.
    function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
                _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
            }
        }
    }
```

The above fucntion which calls the `_notifyUnseenRewards()` function 
```solidity
    /// @notice Checks for and registers any rewards sent to the contract that have not yet been accounted for.
    /// @dev This function is used to update the contract's state with rewards received but not yet recorded,
    ///      for example, tokens sent directly to the contract's address
    ///      It should be called periodically, ideally every 24 hours, to ensure all external rewards are captured.
    /// @param token The address of the reward token to check for new, unseen rewards.
    function _notifyUnseenReward(address token) internal {
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); // Ensures the token address is not zero.
        Reward storage r = rewardData[token]; // Accesses the reward data for the given token.
        uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.

        if (unseen > 0) {
            _notifyReward(token, unseen); // Updates the reward data if there are new rewards.
        }

        emit NotifyUnseenReward(token, unseen); // Emits an event to log the notification of unseen rewards.
    }
```
Here the interesting point it decide call `_notifyReward()` function on the basis of the token balance of the Lock contract here there may be a scenario where the token balance of the Lock contract and unseen reward same value in this situation Malicious user can or user himself can directly send the Minimum amount of token to Lock Contract increase the value and force to call the  `_notifyReward()` function 

```solidity
    /// @notice Updates the reward data for a specific token with a new reward amount.
    /// @dev Adds the specified reward to the cumulative reward for the token, adjusting for the total locked supply with multiplier.
    /// @param _rewardToken The address of the reward token for which to update the reward data.
    /// @param reward The amount of the new reward to be added.
    function _notifyReward(address _rewardToken, uint256 reward) internal {
        if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier == 0)
            return; // If there is no locked supply with multiplier, exit without adding rewards (prevents division by zero).

        Reward storage r = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Accesses the reward structure for the specified token.

        uint256 newReward = reward * 1e36 / lockedSupplyWithMultiplier; // Calculates the reward per token, scaled up for precision.

        r.cumulatedReward += newReward; // Updates the cumulative reward for the token.

        r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.

        r.balance += reward; // Increments the balance of the token by the new reward amount.
    }
```

In above code snippet we can see that 

`newReward` will multiplied by `1e36` and divided by the `lockedSupplyWithMultiplier` this increment the `r.cumulatedReward` state value without receiving the that amount and this may create discrepancy in the accounting of the rewards calculation.

## Impact
The [_notifyReward()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L477) function will be called on the basis of the whether the `unseen` is greater than Zero but sending tokens to the Lock Contract it increases the `unseen` value to atleast one then it force to call the `_notifyReward()` function and it increases the `r.cumulatedReward` state by larger value without having that amount of tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement different  ways to call the `_notifyReward()` function or Maintain internal value to store the balance of lock to calculate Reward of all Token.
