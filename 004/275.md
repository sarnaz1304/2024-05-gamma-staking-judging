# Lack of _disableInitializers Invocation in Lock.sol Implementation

## Summary

The `Lock.sol` contract implements OpenZeppelin’s UUPS model. However, the implementation contract is susceptible to being taken over by an attacker if the `initialize` function is called. To prevent this, it is recommended to invoke the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor. The `Lock.sol` contract and other contracts implementing `PausableUpgradeable` do not currently call `_disableInitializers` in their constructors.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Lock.sol` contract uses OpenZeppelin’s UUPS upgradeability model, which relies on an `initialize` function to set up contract state. If the `_disableInitializers` function is not invoked in the constructor, an attacker can call the `initialize` function on the implementation contract, taking control of it. This vulnerability applies to all contracts implementing `PausableUpgradeable` that do not call `_disableInitializers` in their constructors.

## Impact

An attacker can potentially take control of the implementation contract by calling the `initialize` function. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state, potentially resulting in significant financial loss and loss of control over the contract.

## Code Snippet

The affected contract setup is as follows:

[Line 18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L18-L23)

```solidity
contract Lock is
  ILock,
  Initializable,
  PausableUpgradeable,
  OwnableUpgradeable,
  ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
  // Contract implementation...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Invoke `_disableInitializers` in the constructor of the `Lock.sol` contract and all other contracts implementing `PausableUpgradeable` to prevent unauthorized initialization:

```solidity
contract Lock is
  ILock,
  Initializable,
  PausableUpgradeable,
  OwnableUpgradeable,
  ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
  /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
  constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
  }

  // Contract implementation...
}
```

This change ensures that the implementation contract cannot be initialized by an attacker, maintaining the security and integrity of the contract.
