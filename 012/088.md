# Unchecked Return Value from Lock Removal

## Summary
The `removeFromList` function in the `LockList.sol` contract does not check the return value when removing a lock from the `lockIndexesByUser` mapping. This can lead to silent failures if the provided `lockId` is not present in the mapping.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `LockList.sol`, the [removeFromList](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/libraries/LockList.sol#L47) function attempts to remove a lock identified by the `lockId` parameter from the `lockIndexesByUser` mapping for the specified `user`. However, the function does not check the return value of the `remove` operation, which can return `false` if the `lockId` is not found in the mapping.

## Impact
If the provided `lockId` is not present in the `lockIndexesByUser` mapping for the specified `user`, the `remove` operation will silently do nothing without any indication or error. This can lead to inconsistent state in other contracts, as the lock may still be present in other data structures or mappings, potentially causing issues with accounting or other operations that rely on the correctness of the lock data.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Removes a user's locked balance from the list of locked balances.
 * @param user The address of the user whose balance is being unlocked.
 * @param lockId The unique identifier of the lock to be removed.
 */
function removeFromList(address user, uint256 lockId) public override onlyOwner {
    delete lockById[lockId];

    // @audit-issue L-03 if the lockId is not present, it can pass silently. It doesn't check for return value
    lockIndexesByUser[user].remove(lockId);
    emit LockRemoved(user, lockId);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the `removeFromList` function should check the return value of the `remove` operation and handle the case where the `lockId` is not found in the `lockIndexesByUser` mapping. This can be achieved by either reverting the transaction or emitting an appropriate event to indicate the failure.

Here's an example of how the function could be modified:

```solidity
function removeFromList(address user, uint256 lockId) public override onlyOwner {
    delete lockById[lockId];

    bool removed = lockIndexesByUser[user].remove(lockId);
    if (!removed) {
        // Handle the case where the lockId is not found
        // Option 1: Revert the transaction
        revert("LockId not found");

        // Option 2: Emit an event to indicate the failure
        emit LockRemovalFailed(user, lockId);
    }

    emit LockRemoved(user, lockId);
}
```

By implementing this recommendation, the `removeFromList` function will either revert the transaction or emit an event when the provided `lockId` is not found in the `lockIndexesByUser` mapping. This will ensure that any failures are properly handled and communicated, preventing silent failures and potential inconsistencies in the contract's state.
