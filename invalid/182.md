# Missing size check of `index` on `LockList::getLock` could block users from obtaining penalty amount and unlock period.

## Summary

Missing size check of `index` on `LockList::getLock` could block users from obtaining penalty amount and unlock period.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `LockList::getLock`, a user can get her/his locked balance information based on the provided address and index values. However, the latter must be smaller than the total length of the created lock positions. Such verification is currently missing in the function. It can lead to the `array out-of-bound access` panic, hence, reverting subsequent operations.


```javascript


function getLock(address user, uint256 index) external view override returns (LockedBalance memory) {
@>       return lockById[lockIndexesByUser[user].at(index)];
}
```

## Impact


A user providing a wrong index can see his basic operations failed, e.g. obtaining penalty amount or getting unlock period.


## Code Snippet


Scenario 1:
- User1 wants to calculate the penalty amount, but he provided a wrong index value
- He can't obtain the penalty amount


<details>
<summary>Code</summary>


```javascript


function testUserCantGetPenaltyAmountWithWrongLockIndex() public {
       vm.prank(user1);
       lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0);
       vm.stopPrank();


       vm.prank(deployer);
       lock.setDefaultRelockTime(5);
       vm.stopPrank();


       vm.warp(block.timestamp + 9);
       vm.startPrank(user1);
       LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user1, 1); // NOTE: the index should be 0, which is smaller than 1, the current length of locked positions user1
       uint256 user1BalanceBefore = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);
       lock.earlyExitById(lockedBalance.lockId);
       uint256 user1BalanceAfter = _stakingToken.balanceOf(user1);
       assertEq(user1BalanceBefore + (100e18 - 185e17), user1BalanceAfter);
       vm.stopPrank();
}


```


</details>


Scenario 2:
- User1 wants to get the unlock period, but he provides a wrong index
- He can't obtain such information


<details>
<summary>Code</summary>


```javascript


   function testUserCantCalculateUnlockPeriod() public {
       vm.prank(user1);
       lock.stake(100e18, user1, 0); // User A stakes with the first lock type


       vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days); // Simulate passing 15 days
       LockedBalance memory lockedBalance = lock.locklist().getLock(user1, 1); // NOTE: the index should be 0, which is smaller than 1, the current length of locked positions user1
       uint256 remainPeriod = lock.calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lockedBalance);
       console.log("Default relockTime = ", lock.defaultRelockTime());
       assertEq(remainPeriod, 15 days, "Remaining unlock period should be 15 days for User A.");
   }
```


</details>


Running both test cases will result in this exception `[FAIL. Reason: panic: array out-of-bounds access (0x32)]`.


## Tool used

Manual review.


## Recommendation

Consider adding the following modification to `LockList.sol`:


```diff
...
+ error IndexBiggerThanLockIndexSetLength();
...


function getLock(address user, uint256 index) external view override returns (LockedBalance memory) {
+   if (index >= lockIndexesByUser[user].length()) revert IndexBiggerThanLockIndexSetLength();
   return lockById[lockIndexesByUser[user].at(index)];
}

```
