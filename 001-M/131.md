# DoS on `Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` by abusing staking on behalf of another address

## Summary

By allowing staking on behalf of another address, an attacker could add many locks to a victim's `LockList`, which would deny the victim the usage of any functions required looping through the `LockList`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because the function "Lock::stake()" supports staking on behalf of another address, an attacker could repeatedly stake a small amount of token on behalf of a victim, which would create many locks on the victim's `LockList`. As a result, any functions required looping the through the victim's `LockList` would suffer an Out of Gas error.

## Impact

The victim would receive an Out Of Gas error when using the `Lock::withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function.

            vm.prank(user1);
            lock.stake(1, user2, 0);
        }

        vm.prank(user2);
        lock.withdrawAllUnlockedToken();
    }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Disable staking on behalf of another address.
2. Add an internal staking function that allow staking on behalf of another address in order for the `Lock::restakeAfterLateExit()` function to work properly.
