# [H-2] Smart Contract Issue: DoS Vulnerability in Token Withdrawal Function



## Summary
The smart contract in question has a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker can stake a large amount of tokens each in very small quantities, thereby increasing the size of the lock array. By calling the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function in a loop without calling `exitLateById` , the contract could be kept busy with the same transaction, checking the array repeatedly.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken` function of the contract. This function retrieves a list of locks for the user and checks if the unlock time is less than the current block timestamp. If it is, the function adds up the amount from all unlocked balances and removes the lock from the list. However, an attacker can exploit this by staking a large number of tokens in small quantities and calling this function in a loop, which would make contract executing this function for the attacker contract almost all the possible time. This could potentially keep the contract busy, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant. A successful DoS attack could make the smart contract unresponsive, preventing other users from interacting with it. This could affect the overall functionality of the contract and could potentially lead to loss of trust among the users.

    }

        lock.stake(1,user1,0);

        }
         for(uint256 i =0;i<=1000e15;i++){
        vm.prank(user1);
        lock.withdrawAllUnlockedToken();}


        vm.prank(user1);
        assert( _stakingToken.balanceOf(user4) == 10000e3);
        // killed
        
    }

}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a mechanism that prevents the same user from calling the withdrawAllUnlockedToken function repeatedly in a short period of time. This could be achieved by implementing a cooldown  period or by limiting the number of times the function can be called within a certain timeframe. This would prevent the contract from being kept busy with the same transaction and protect it from potential DoS attacks.
