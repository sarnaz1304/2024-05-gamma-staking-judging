# Missing whenNotPaused Modifier in Critical Functions

## Summary
Several critical functions in the Lock contract do not implement the whenNotPaused modifier, allowing operations to be performed even when the contract is paused. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawals and other security issues during emergency situations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` and ` withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id)`  lack the whenNotPaused modifier. This omission allows these functions to be executed even when the contract is paused, which is intended to prevent operations during emergencies or attacks.



## Impact

1. Bypassing Emergency Pauses: The absence of the whenNotPaused modifier allows users to execute these functions even when the contract is paused. This defeats the purpose of pausing the contract during emergencies or attacks.
3. Inconsistent State: Allowing operations during a paused state can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state, making it difficult to manage and recover from attacks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` , `withdrawUnlockedTokenById(uint256 id)` functions to ensure they cannot be executed when the contract is paused. This will prevent unauthorized withdrawals and maintain the integrity of the contract during emergency situations.
