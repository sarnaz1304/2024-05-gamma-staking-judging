# Unused returns

## Summary
Unused returns in `Lock::_stake`, `LockList::addToList` & `LockList::removeFromList`. The return value of an external call is not stored in a local or state variable. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Ignoring the return value of function calls, can lead to several issues in smart contracts, primarily because it prevents the detection of failure conditions that could otherwise be caught and handled gracefully. In the context of the `Lock` contract and its interaction with the `LockList` library, ignoring return values can have specific implications.

## Impact
1. Loss of Control Flow Information: By not checking the return value of functions like `LockList::addToList` and `LockList::removeFromList`, you lose the ability to react to errors or unexpected states. For instance, if `addToList` fails to add a lock for some reason (e.g., due to exceeding a maximum limit), you won't know unless you check its return value.

2. Potential for Silent Failures: Ignoring return values can lead to silent failures where operations fail but the contract continues executing as if everything went smoothly. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state, making debugging and maintenance more challenging.

3. Security Implications: In some cases, ignoring return values can expose the contract to security vulnerabilities. For example, if `removeFromList` fails to remove a lock but doesn't revert, it could lead to duplicate entries or other integrity issues.

## Recommendation
Ensure that all the return values of the function calls are used. Where possible, check the return values of functions that indicate success or failure. This allows you to handle errors gracefully and maintain control over the contract's state.
