## Summary
The admin of `lock. sol` can maliciously deny services like exiting early using the privilages awarded to him by the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `lock.sol` and `Locklist.sol` contracts are ownable and some functions can be operated by only the owner. 

The admin can use some of the Ownable functions like `setIsEarlyExitDisabled` and `setPenaltyCalcAttributes` to deny users services like early exit from a stake and also can increase penalties respectively. 

## Impact
Such actions may make certain aspects of the protocol inaccessible or may make it less profitable to the users.

## Code Snippet
```Solidity 
function setIsEarlyExitDisabled(bool _isEarlyExitDisabled) external onlyOwner;

function setPenaltyCalcAttributes(uint256 _basePenaltyPercentage, uint256 _timePenaltyFraction) external onlyOwner

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider involving governance or community voting to determine when the Ownable functions should be transparently called.
