# Users can receive 0% penalties if decide to early exit

## Summary

Users who stake GAMMA token to the protocol have the option to early exit by calling the `Lock::earlyExitById` function by providing their lock id but the protocol applies penalties for such cases base penalty, which is fixed percentage from his staked amount and time-based penalty, which reduces linearly the more the user keeps his tokens staked. However users can avoid these penalties fully if decide to exit up to 74 seconds (1 minute and 14 seconds) before the unlock period. 

`Lock::earlyExitById` function: 

```javascript
function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        ...
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
        ...

function calcRemainUnlockPeriod(LockedBalance memory userLock) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lockTime = userLock.lockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        
        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - lockTime) < lockPeriod) {
            // If the adjusted lock period is less than or equal to the default relock time, or if the current time is still within the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the adjusted lock period.
            return lockPeriod - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % lockPeriod;
        } else {
            // If the current time exceeds the adjusted lock period, return the remaining time based on the default relock time.
            return defaultRelockTime - (block.timestamp - lockTime) % defaultRelockTime;
        }
```

As can be seen above the `coolDownSecs` assings the remaining time until a user's locked balance can be unlocked in seconds. And then is assigned to `unlockTime`. Next the `unlockTime` value plays a crutial role in determining the penalty factor: 

```javascript
function calcPenaltyAmount(LockedBalance memory userLock) public  returns (uint256 penaltyAmount) {
        if (userLock.amount == 0) return 0; // Return zero if there is no amount locked to avoid unnecessary calculations.
@>        uint256 unlockTime = userLock.unlockTime;
        uint256 lockPeriod = userLock.lockPeriod;
        uint256 penaltyFactor;


        if (lockPeriod <= defaultRelockTime || (block.timestamp - userLock.lockTime) < lockPeriod) {

@>            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / lockPeriod + basePenaltyPercentage;
      }
        else {
@>            penaltyFactor = (unlockTime - block.timestamp) * timePenaltyFraction / defaultRelockTime + basePenaltyPercentage;
        }

        // Apply the calculated penalty factor to the locked amount.
        penaltyAmount = userLock.amount * penaltyFactor / WHOLE;
```

## Vulnerability Detail

Let me demonstrate PoC, im using examples with the values for the lock periods given in the protocol's README in the contest page

If lock period is set to 30 days (2592000) or default relock time is set to 30 days but lock period is >, it will do one the calculations shown above. 

1. `unlockTime - block.timestamp` here it subtracts by the current timestamp because in early exit function adds it, so the point is to get the correct value. Consider it's 74 seconds
2. `timePenaltyFraction` will be 35% as stated in the `Lock` natspec so it will be 35000
3. `basePenaltyPercentage` will be 15% -> 15000 

Poc:

```javascript
penaltyFactor = 74 * 35000 / 2592000 + 15000
penaltyFactor = 2590000 / 2607000
penaltyFactor = 0

penaltyAmount =  1e18 (for example) * 0 / 100000 (WHOLE)
penaltyAmount = 0
```

Any value less than 74 seconds will result in the same penalty amount.

## Impact

The exploit demonstrated above breaks the intented lock mechanism. As the penalty amounts are later sent to the treasury contract. This scenario can be even more harmful to the protocol if other users notice and start doing the same.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Restrict users to exit at least 2 mins prior to their unlock time or better option just if the penalty amount is 0 revert.
