# Lack of minimum threshold amount for `stake`

## Summary
The [Lock::stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol#L260-L307) function does not enforce a minimum threshold for the staking amount. This allows users to stake very small (dust) amounts, which can lead to potential rounding issues in accounting and increase the risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks due to a high number of small transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `stake` function allows users to stake any amount of tokens, including very small amounts (dust). Without a minimum threshold, these small transactions can cause rounding errors in reward calculations and other accounting processes. Additionally, a large number of such small transactions can clog the system, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by exhausting computational resources and storage.

A malicious user can really easily fill up the lock mappings by staking 1 WEI.

## Impact
Medium. Small amounts can cause rounding errors, leading to inaccuracies in reward calculations and overall accounting. Allowing many small transactions can lead to excessive resource usage causing the system to become unresponsive and unusable.
> Out of Gas: Issues that result in Out of Gas errors either by the malicious user filling up the arrays or there is a practical call flow that results in OOG can be considered a valid medium or in cases of blocking all user funds forever maybe a valid high.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a state variable for the minimum stake amount and ensure it is checked in the `_stake` function. Set a reasonable default value for `minStakeAmount` during the contract initialization to ensure there is always a threshold. This ensures that users can only stake a meaningful amount of tokens.
