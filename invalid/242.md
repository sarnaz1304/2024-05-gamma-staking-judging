# Lack of IERC20Upgradeable Usage in Lock Contract

## Summary
The Lock contract currently uses the IERC20 interface and SafeERC20 library, which are not designed for upgradeable contracts. This can cause several issues

## Vulnerability Detail
The Lock contract is designed to be upgradeable but does not use the IERC20Upgradeable interface for interacting with ERC20 tokens. While it has been argued that USDT and USDC do not require the use of upgradeable contracts, the Lock contract can handle reward tokens that may include a variety of ERC20 tokens, not limited to USDT and USDC. This lack of upgradeable interface usage can lead to significant issues in the future, especially when dealing with tokens that require upgradeability patterns.

Code Snippet:
```solidity
import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import {SafeERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
```

## Impact

The lack of IERC20Upgradeable usage can lead to:
	-Data corruption or loss due to storage layout conflicts.
	-Initialization issues due to incompatible constructors.
	-Deployment and upgrade errors due to incompatibility with upgrade plugins.
