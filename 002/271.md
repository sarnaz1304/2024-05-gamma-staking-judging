# Griefing attack on stakers can render withdrawAllUnlockedToken() not to function as intended

## Summary
Griefing attack on stakers can render withdrawAllUnlockedToken() not to function as intended 

## Vulnerability Detail
The external `stake()` function allows anyone to stake on behalf of any address, however the calling of stake() increasing the specified addresses locklist:
```solidity
locklist.addToList(
            onBehalfOf, 
            LockedBalance({
                lockId: 0, // This will be set inside the addToList function
                amount: amount,
                unlockTime: 0, 
                multiplier: multiplier,
                lockTime: block.timestamp,
                lockPeriod: lockPeriod[typeIndex],
                exitedLate: false
            })
        );
```
```solidity
lockIndexesByUser[user].add(globalLockId);
```
Also, note that there is not min stake amount required to stake onbehalf of anyone including just 1wei. This means attackers can increase any staker locklist sufficiently with add lock positions of just 1wei, forcing staker to manually remove them by themselves one at a time.

These also affect the intended design of the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` which attackers can render it useless for staker by increasing their lockCount sufficiently to cause a revert such as Out Of Gas e.t.c upon calling `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()`:
```solidity
while (limit < lockCount) {
            LockedBalance[] memory lockedBals = locklist.getLocks(msg.sender, page, lockCount); // Retrieves a page of locks for the user.
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < lockedBals.length; i++) { // @> iterates through all of the staker's locks
                if (lockedBals[i].unlockTime != 0 && lockedBals[i].unlockTime < block.timestamp) {
                    totalUnlocked += lockedBals[i].amount; // Adds up the amount from all unlocked balances.
                    locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockedBals[i].lockId); // Removes the lock from the list.
                }
            }

            limit += 10; // Moves to the next page of locks.
            page++;
        }
```
## Impact
affect the intended design of the `withdrawAllUnlockedToken()` function for stakers and would cost stakers if they decide to remove them from their locks by themselves without the option to prevent anyone from just adding more lock to their locklist.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow stakers to grant permissions for who can stake on their behalf and check that on the msg.sender on the stake function
