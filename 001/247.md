# If any 'rewardToken` reverts, all other rewards processing will be bricked.

## Summary
The current implementation of `notifyUnseenReward` could lead to a scenario where rewards processing will be bricked.
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see _`notifyUnseenReward` iterates over all reward Tokens without a method to remove or select tokens.
Due to this if for any reason any token's `balanceOf` call reverts it would lead to a scenario where a single reverting rewardToken would revert the iteration over all the tokens, permanently preventing updating reward balances.

  /// @notice Checks for and registers any rewards sent to the contract that have not yet been accounted for.
    /// @dev This function is used to update the contract's state with rewards received but not yet recorded, 
    ///      for example, tokens sent directly to the contract's address 
    ///      It should be called periodically, ideally every 24 hours, to ensure all external rewards are captured.
    /// @param token The address of the reward token to check for new, unseen rewards.
    function _notifyUnseenReward(address token) internal {
        if (token == address(0)) revert AddressZero(); // Ensures the token address is not zero.
        Reward storage r = rewardData[token]; // Accesses the reward data for the given token.
        uint256 unseen = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - r.balance; // Calculates the amount of new, unseen rewards.

        if (unseen > 0) {
            _notifyReward(token, unseen); // Updates the reward data if there are new rewards.
        }

        emit NotifyUnseenReward(token, unseen); // Emits an event to log the notification of unseen rewards.
    }

        if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier == 0)
            return; // If there is no locked supply with multiplier, exit without adding rewards (prevents division by zero).

        Reward storage r = rewardData[_rewardToken]; // Accesses the reward structure for the specified token.
        uint256 newReward = reward * 1e36 / lockedSupplyWithMultiplier; // Calculates the reward per token, scaled up for precision.
        r.cumulatedReward += newReward; // Updates the cumulative reward for the token.
        r.lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp; // Sets the last update time to now.
        r.balance += reward; // Increments the balance of the token by the new reward amount.
    }



    /// @notice Checks and updates unseen rewards for a list of reward tokens.
    /// @dev Iterates through the provided list of reward tokens and triggers the _notifyUnseenReward function for each if it has been previously added to the contract.
    /// @param _rewardTokens An array of reward token addresses to check and update for unseen rewards.
    function notifyUnseenReward(address[] memory _rewardTokens) external {
        uint256 length = rewardTokens.length; // Gets the number of reward tokens currently recognized by the contract.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            if (rewardTokenAdded[_rewardTokens[i]]) {
                _notifyUnseenReward(_rewardTokens[i]); // Processes each token to update any unseen rewards.
            }
        }

>[!IMPORTANT] 
Surprisingly this same finding was reported in their private audit too [M:06](https://gist.github.com/guhu95/84b0cc9237fab81c9d64b385b0974e23#yellow_circle--m-06-reverting--rewardtoken-can-brick-all-rewards-processing)
## Impact
Protocol would lose funds which will make it lose its credibility among users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Allow specifying a subset of tokens to process during notifyUnseenReward.
