# Dangerous strict equality

## Summary
`Lock::notifyReward` uses a dangerous strict equality leading to potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Strict equalities (==) can lead to unexpected behaviors due to the way Solidity handles type conversions and comparisons, especially with types like uint that cannot represent negative values. Here's how you can address these warnings:

## Impact
The impact of using dangerous strict equalities in smart contracts, as highlighted can vary widely depending on the context of the contract and how the strict equality is applied.

## Code Snippet
In the `Lock::_notifyReward` function, the condition if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier == 0) uses a strict equality check. This could potentially lead to issues if lockedSupplyWithMultiplier is somehow manipulated to become a very large positive number, which would pass the strict equality check but likely not the intended logic of the function.

Similarly, in the calcPenaltyAmount function, the condition if (userLock.amount == 0) is flagged. This could lead to similar issues as described above, especially if userLock.amount is manipulated to become a very large positive number.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a boolean equality check instead of a strict equality check. This change ensures that the condition behaves as expected even when dealing with large numbers.

```javascript
function _notifyReward(address _rewardToken, uint256 reward) internal {
    if (lockedSupplyWithMultiplier!= 0) return;
}
```
