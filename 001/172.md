# `earlyExitById` function doesn't account for users `rewardDebt`  and rewards he accumulated till then correctly.

## Summary
If the user's balance is reduced to 0 before calculating the `rewardDebt` and paying out the rewards he had accumulated the user won't be able to get any rewards and the value of the `rewardDebt` will be 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
By calling the `earlyExitById` function the user is not eligible to accumulate any more rewards and he has a penalty he pays before getting the amount he had staked at first. But the problem lies where the user's balance is reduced to 0 before calculating the `rewardDebt` and before the user is able to collect the rewards he had accumulated till then. 
```solidity
    function earlyExitById(uint256 lockId) external whenNotPaused {
        if (isEarlyExitDisabled) {
            revert EarlyExitDisabled();
        }
        _updateReward(msg.sender);

        LockedBalance memory lock = locklist.getLockById(msg.sender, lockId);

        if (lock.unlockTime != 0) 
            revert InvalidLockId();
        uint256 coolDownSecs = calcRemainUnlockPeriod(lock);
        lock.unlockTime = block.timestamp + coolDownSecs;
        uint256 penaltyAmount = calcPenaltyAmount(lock);
        locklist.removeFromList(msg.sender, lockId); 
        Balances storage bal = balances[msg.sender];
        lockedSupplyWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;
        lockedSupply -= lock.amount;
        bal.locked -= lock.amount;
        bal.lockedWithMultiplier -= lock.amount * lock.multiplier;

        _updateRewardDebt(msg.sender); 

        if (lock.amount > penaltyAmount) {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount);
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, penaltyAmount);
            emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, lock.amount - penaltyAmount, penaltyAmount);
        } else {
            IERC20(stakingToken).safeTransfer(treasury, lock.amount);
        emit EarlyExitById(lockId, msg.sender, 0, penaltyAmount);
        }
    }
```
As we can see here when `_updateRewardDebt` function is called  for the user, the balance for the `rewardDebt` for the user will be set to 0 because the user's balance was reduced previously.  But this is not the only problem, by not sending the user his rewards prior to reducing his balance, now when the user calls the `getReward` function his rewards will be calculated as 0 because his balance was reduced to 0 and the `rewardDebt` was set to 0. These are the calculations that are done:
```solidity
 earnings = rewardInfo.cumulatedReward * balance.lockedWithMultiplier - rewardDebt[_user][_rewardToken];
```
This is the calculation that is done in the `_earned` function which sets the amount of rewards the user is eligible to withdraw. The earnings will be set to 0 and now when the user gets to the `_getReward` function his reward is 0.
```solidity
 function _getReward(
        address _user,
        address[] memory _rewardTokens
    ) internal whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = _rewardTokens.length; // Get the number of reward tokens to process.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
            address token = _rewardTokens[i]; // Get the current token address.

            uint256 reward = rewards[_user][token]; // Retrieve the amount of reward due for the user and the token.
            if (reward > 0) {
                rewards[_user][token] = 0; // Reset the reward to zero after claiming.
                rewardData[token].balance -= reward / 1e36; // Deduct the reward from the stored balance, adjusting for decimals.

                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_user, reward / 1e36); // Transfer the reward to the user.
                rewardPaid[_user][token] += reward / 1e36; // Update the total reward paid to the user for this token.  
                emit RewardPaid(_user, token, reward / 1e36); // Emit an event documenting the reward payment.
            }
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
This function will automatically revert at this line `if (reward > 0)` because his reward is 0 and the user will end up with no rewards.

## Impact
Not accounting for the user's `rewardDebt` correctly and reducing his balance before paying out the rewards he accumulated till then can lead to the user not being able to get any of the rewards.

## Recommendation
Calculate the user's `rewardDebt` with the `_updateRewardDebt` function and payout his rewards he accumulated till then before reducing his balance to 0.
