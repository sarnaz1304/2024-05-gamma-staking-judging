# Uninitialized Inherited Contracts in Upgradeable Smart Contract Pose Severe Security Risks

## Summary
The Lock smart contract inherits from several OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts but does not call the initializer functions for all inherited contracts. This can lead to critical vulnerabilities and unpredictable behavior.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract fails to call the initializer functions of PausableUpgradeable and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable. This omission leaves the contract without proper setup for pause functionality and reentrancy checks, which are vital for security and control.
## Impact
The lack of initialization for PausableUpgradeable and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable can lead to severe issues if other values occupy the storage slots that these contracts use. Since this is an upgradeable contract, the storage layout must remain consistent across upgrades. If the storage slots expected to be used by uninitialized contracts already contain data, it could result in erratic behavior, including but not limited to:

- The contract could be paused or unpaused incorrectly due to unexpected initial values in the PausableUpgradeable storage slot.
- The reentrancy guard could fail to prevent reentrant calls, as the _status variable in ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable may not start at the expected NOT_ENTERED state.
These issues are particularly critical in upgradeable contracts, where storage slots are preserved between upgrades, and any - misalignment can cause persistent and hard-to-detect faults.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _locklist,
    uint128 _basePenaltyPercentage,
    uint128 _timePenaltyFraction,
    address _owner
) public initializer {
    __Ownable_init(_owner); // Correctly initialized
    // Missing initializers for PausableUpgradeable and ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
    ...
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the initialize function to include the missing initializer calls:
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _locklist,
    uint128 _basePenaltyPercentage,
    uint128 _timePenaltyFraction,
    address _owner
) public initializer {
    __Ownable_init(_owner);
    __Pausable_init(); // Initialize PausableUpgradeable
    __ReentrancyGuard_init(); // Initialize ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
    ...
}
```
